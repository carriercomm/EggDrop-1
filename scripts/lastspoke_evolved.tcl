# lastspoke_evolved.tcl v0.2
#
# An eggdrop script to keep track of when people last spoke;
# Tracks users who have left or parted channel as well as
# those currently in channel.
#
# USE: "-totals" to check usage of memory consumption and size
# of array used to track spoke data
#
# Master/Owner: Use !spokeclean or !cleanspoke to prune your
# spoke data down to just active users presently in channels.
#

#
# SPECIAL NOTE, DONT MISS THIS OR YOU MAY GET PISSED OFF
# TO KEEP YOUR CHANNEL SECRET:
# .chanset #yourchan +spokesecret
#
# Otherwise, everything said by everyone will be logged. With
# the channel set SECRET only the last time said is kept, what
# was said is replaced with a message indicating it's a secret.
