This is NOT <strong>reciprocity</strong>.</p> <p>The <strong>Concealed Carry Reciprocity Maps</strong> above will show you:</p> <p><strong>Map 1 &#8211; States That Honor My Permit(s):</strong><br /> The first screen on this map shows whether a state is <strong>Shall Issue</strong>, <strong>May Issue</strong>, or <strong>Right Denied</strong>.</p> <p><strong>Shall Issue</strong>: States that are <strong>Shall Issue</strong> will issue any private citizen a <strong>concealed weapons permit</strong> as long as they meet all requirements.</p> <p><strong>May Issue</strong>: States that are <strong>May Issue</strong> have the authority to take judgment on whether or not they want to issue a <strong>concealed weapons permit</strong> to a private citizen even after they have met all requirements.</p> <p><strong>Right Denied</strong>: States that are <strong>Right Denied</strong> DO NOT allows private citizens to carry handguns and do not issue <strong>concealed weapon permits</strong>.</p> <p>To view which states accept your <strong>concealed weapons permit</strong>, just click on the state your permit is issued in. If you have multiple permits, start with your <strong>Resident Permit</strong> (The permit issued in the state you live in).</p> <p>You may be asked if your <strong>concealed weapons permit</strong> is a Resident or Non-Resident permit. Some states issue permits to Residents of their state as well as Non-Residents. On the other hand, some state&#8217;s ONLY issue to Residents of their state. And to take it one step further, some states only allow permits issued to Residents of the states they have <strong>reciprocity</strong> with. This is what the yellow state color means on the map.</p> <p>If you need to reset the map and start over just click on the Clear Map button.</p> <p><strong>Map 2 &#8211; Permits Honored by State</strong><br /> This map is a quick way to find out what state <strong>concealed carry permits</strong> a particular state allows. Just click on a state and any states that are blue are allowed within the selected state, red are not allowed, and yellow means only residents of that state that have permits are allowed. </td> <td valign="top"></td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>Check out <a href="http://onthevise.com" target="_blank" title="On The Vise">On The Vise</a>, the new <a href="http://onthevise.com" title="Fly Tying">Fly Tying</a> site by the creator of USA Carry.</p> <div class="printfriendly pf-alignright"><a href="http://www.printfriendly.com/print?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.usacarry.com%2Fconcealed_carry_permit_reciprocity_maps.html" rel="nofollow" onclick="window.print(); return false;"><img style="border:none;-webkit-box-shadow:none; box-shadow:none;" src="http://cdn.printfriendly.com/pf-button.gif" alt="Print Friendly" /></a></div></div> </section><!-- /.entry -->  <div class="fix"></div> </article><!-- /.post --> <div id="disqus_thread">             <div id="dsq-content">             <ul id="dsq-comments">                     <li class="comment even thread-even depth-1" id="dsq-comment-24">         <div id="dsq-comment-header-24" class="dsq-comment-header">             <cite id="dsq-cite-24">                 <span id="dsq-author-user-24">Sscsmi</span>             </cite>         </div>         <div id="dsq-comment-body-24" class="dsq-comment-body">             <div id="dsq-comment-message-24" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>This map is incorrect; the State of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations is a MAY ISSUE.

However state laws shows that the AG&#8217;s office is MAY ISSUE but it also shows that the Chief of Police for the City or Town you reside or work in SHALL ISSUE you a permit if you met the criteria established by law; however, they often refuse to do say claiming they dont have the authoirty until you file suit against both that city adn the chief of police specifically then they will follow the law and issue the permit.

When the Nevada DPS first began its state by state audit of Right-to-Carry laws in 2007, DPS admitted to NRA representatives that they overlooked the live fire training requirement.

I used to only vote for who I thought was the best candidate, but lately that doesn&#8217;t matter. Republicans will vote for Republican bills and Democrats will vote for Democratic bills. Until the party leaders stop putting so much pressure on the freshmen Representatives and even on the Senators we don&#8217;t have much of a choice. What we need to do is start telling all of them, if you don&#8217;t stop all of this partisan crap and just start fixing the problems then your all fired. In all honesty what is best for this country is to take some of the Democrats views and some of the Republicans views and combine them.

Britain, when we were sensible<br /> of danger, we had daily prayer in this room for Divine protection. &#8211; Our<br />  prayers, Sir, were heard, &amp; they were graciousy answered.

And<br /> have we now forgotten that powerful Friend? or do we imagine we no<br /> longer need His assistance?</p> <p>I have lived, Sir, a long time, and the longer I live, the more<br /> convincing proofs I see of this truth &#8211; That God Governs in the affairs<br /> of men.  And if a sparrow cannot fall to the ground without His notice,<br /> is it probable that an empire can rise without His aid?</p> <p>We have been assured, Sir, in the Sacred Writings, that &#8220;except the Lord<br />  build the House, they labor in vain that build it.&#8221;  I firmly believe<br /> this; and I also believe that without his concurring aid we shall<br /> succeed in this political building no better than the Builders of Babel:<br />   We shall be divided by our partial local interests; our projects will<br /> be confounded, and we ourselves shall become a reproach and bye word<br /> down to future ages.</p> <p>And what is worse, mankind may hereafter from this unfortunate instance,<br />  despair of establishing Governments by human wisdom and leave it to<br /> chance, war and conquest.</p> <p>I therefore beg leave to move &#8211; that henceforth prayers imploring the<br /> assistance of Heaven, and its blessing on our deliberations, be held in<br /> this Assembly every morning before we proceed to business, and that one<br /> or more of the clergy of this city be requested to officiate in that<br /> service.&#8221;</p> </div>         </div>     </li><!-- #comment-## -->     <li class="comment even depth-5" id="dsq-comment-1587">         <div id="dsq-comment-header-1587" class="dsq-comment-header">             <cite id="dsq-cite-1587">                 <span id="dsq-author-user-1587">B1itsjustme</span>             </cite>         </div>         <div id="dsq-comment-body-1587" class="dsq-comment-body">             <div id="dsq-comment-message-1587" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>That sir is incorrect and you probably know it.

It is<br /> therefore that the older I grow, the more apt I am to doubt my own judgment,<br /> and to pay more respect to the judgment of others. Most men indeed as well as<br /> most sects in Religion, think themselves in possession of all truth, and that<br /> wherever others differ from them it is so far error. Steele a Protestant in a<br /> Dedication tells the Pope, that the only difference between our Churches in<br /> their opinions of the certainty of their doctrines is, the Church of Rome is<br /> infallible and the Church of England is never in the wrong. But though many<br /> private persons think almost as highly of their own infallibility as of that of<br /> their sect, few express it so naturally as a certain french lady, who in a<br /> dispute with her sister, said &#8220;I don&#8217;t know how it happens, Sister but I meet<br /> with no body but myself, that&#8217;s always in the right — Il n&#8217;y a que moi<br /> qui a toujours raison.&#8221;</p> </div>         </div>     </li><!-- #comment-## -->     <li class="comment odd alt depth-5" id="dsq-comment-2964">         <div id="dsq-comment-header-2964" class="dsq-comment-header">             <cite id="dsq-cite-2964">                 <span id="dsq-author-user-2964">wonder worm</span>             </cite>         </div>         <div id="dsq-comment-body-2964" class="dsq-comment-body">             <div id="dsq-comment-message-2964" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>and if my aunt had balls, she would be my uncle.</p> </div>         </div>     </li><!-- #comment-## -->     <li class="comment even depth-5" id="dsq-comment-3568">         <div id="dsq-comment-header-3568" class="dsq-comment-header">             <cite id="dsq-cite-3568">                 <span id="dsq-author-user-3568">Anonymous</span>             </cite>         </div>         <div id="dsq-comment-body-3568" class="dsq-comment-body">             <div id="dsq-comment-message-3568" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>. . .and prone to vulgarity just as you are.</p> </div>         </div>     </li><!-- #comment-## -->     <li class="comment odd alt depth-5" id="dsq-comment-3567">         <div id="dsq-comment-header-3567" class="dsq-comment-header">             <cite id="dsq-cite-3567">                 <span id="dsq-author-user-3567">Anonymous</span>             </cite>         </div>         <div id="dsq-comment-body-3567" class="dsq-comment-body">             <div id="dsq-comment-message-3567" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Well done!</p> </div>         </div>     </li><!-- #comment-## -->     <li class="comment even depth-5" id="dsq-comment-3110">         <div id="dsq-comment-header-3110" class="dsq-comment-header">             <cite id="dsq-cite-3110">                 <span id="dsq-author-user-3110">The7thson</span>             </cite>         </div>         <div id="dsq-comment-body-3110" class="dsq-comment-body">             <div id="dsq-comment-message-3110" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Your translation of &#8220;Novus Ordo Seclorum&#8221; as &#8220;A New Secular Order&#8221; only shows that you have an abysmal ignorance of Latin.</p> <p>Novus Ordo Seclorum means a &#8220;New Order of the Ages&#8221;.</p> <p>As for your &#8220;separation of church and state&#8221; argument &#8211; The 1st Amendment only says that Congress will not establish a national religion.  It does NOT say that all religious discourse is to be banned from the public square.</p> </div>         </div>     </li><!-- #comment-## -->     <li class="comment odd alt depth-5" id="dsq-comment-3566">         <div id="dsq-comment-header-3566" class="dsq-comment-header">             <cite id="dsq-cite-3566">                 <span id="dsq-author-user-3566">Anonymous</span>             </cite>         </div>         <div id="dsq-comment-body-3566" class="dsq-comment-body">             <div id="dsq-comment-message-3566" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>No, you have succumbed to the propaganda of the left.

The whole point of separation from England was that the crown was trying to usurp God granted rights. The founders were saying, God gave man the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. These rights are not granted by men to other men but come from the Creator. As such they can not be regulated, controlled or revoked by men.

As far as not changing something that has worked for years, I&#8217;m not sure I follow that. Are we talking guns, which you have to admit needs something done. God? Hell that changes all the time.

Do you really believe that gay rights as an issue of equality is a threat to something? What does it threaten? Please don&#8217;t recite the same old tired rhetoric that has been repeated to the point that people want to fall asleep when they hear it. Current national polls clearly show that the vast majority support gay rights as an equality issue. The only groups who oppose are the illiterate, the ultra-right win religious, who are led around by their so call spiritual advisors, and the elderly, over 70. of course there are sub groups who oppose, but they don&#8217;t have any original reasons. The main arguments againts gay rights have been disproven time and time again. Gay people are not a threat to our children, they don&#8217;t rape, and they are not out to take over the world. I find it funny when people use those arguments. Arrest records throughout the country prove that &#8220;straight&#8221; men comit more crimes against children of both sexes than any other group for all crimes.

He&#8217;s made no outrageous claims, called for no illegal or violent actions, and has merely stated that supporters of gun-rights should band together in a union to get a collective/larger voice for their issue. This is no less or no more than teachers do, machinists do, firefighters do&#8230; are you going to call for their rights to be infringed?<br /> Look to the message (without reading your own bias into it) and not the passion with which it&#8217;s delivered.<br /> Given the choice between a passionate supporter of my rights (wildmangood2000) and someone who&#8217;s quick to jump on the &#8216;for me but not thee&#8217; bandwagon without supporting evidence (Dellavar), I&#8217;d much rather arm wildmangood2000.

Maybe it didn&#8217;t help his cause that he went on Judge Napolitans&#8217;s TV show and they both mocked the judge before sentencing.  Thank God for Gov. Christie!  He pardoned the kid and fired the judge.  I&#8217;m still wary though.  People who actually commit crimes don&#8217;t get that harsh of a sentence.  Will only retire to a state with shall issue law.

Talk about imposing on others rights.  What gives you the right to tell someone who&#8217;sbeing attacked they can&#8217;t protect themselves?

Further, no permit is required AT ALL, of residents or non-residents alike, to carry concealed in most places within the state. There are a few exceptions to this, CCW holders can carry in a few places non-holders can not and there are places, such as courtrooms, federal buildings, etc&#8230; where NO ONE other than L.E. can carry.

The current government is acting very much like the English government did back then. They have the idea that &#8220;they&#8221; know better than us &#8220;common&#8221; people. Remember Obama&#8217;s remark that he wished he could just rule the country without answering to anyone else? Another important basic truth is that the founders of our country based the Declaration of Independence on GOD given rights and morals. Read the first two paragraphs if not the whole thing. It is short. Same for the Constitution. At the time of the writing of the Constitution, 98.4% of Americans were Protestant Christians, 1.4% Catholics, and .2% other, mostly Jews. There were an insignificant number of atheists and agnostics. Only two of the delegates were not professing Christians. Ben Franklyn was an agnostic, but he still believed in and touted the morals of Christianity. The Constitutional Convention started with a THREE HOUR prayer session.

So depends entirely on the county and that sheriff&#8217;s policy.</p> </div>         </div>     </li><!-- #comment-## --> </ul><!-- .children --> </li><!-- #comment-## -->     <li class="comment even thread-even depth-1" id="dsq-comment-3378">         <div id="dsq-comment-header-3378" class="dsq-comment-header">             <cite id="dsq-cite-3378">                 <span id="dsq-author-user-3378">xdmowner615</span>             </cite>         </div>         <div id="dsq-comment-body-3378" class="dsq-comment-body">             <div id="dsq-comment-message-3378" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Umm this is confusing because I select my state and all the states but 4 are lit up&#8230; I know this is not correct information.. any assitance?

Keep it up. I still stand by my earlier post, and YES, I have read the history of our early country and the Constitutional convention. My facts are correct except for one thing, I Called Ben Franklyn an agnostic and, as Truthseeker pointed out, he was a deist. A deist is one who believes there is a God on the evidence of reason and nature only. Ben believed in God, he just didn&#8217;t know much about Him and didn&#8217;t commit. If you don&#8217;t believe that there is a God look at a newborn baby and explain to me how that happened, other than the basics of conception. Billions of cells began as two conjoined cells and differentiated themselves into the thousands of body parts that make us what we are; coincidence, evolution, what?? Try throwing a bunch of parts into a bucket and see if a clock evolves. </p> </div>         </div>     </li><!-- #comment-## -->     <li class="comment even thread-even depth-1" id="dsq-comment-3586">         <div id="dsq-comment-header-3586" class="dsq-comment-header">             <cite id="dsq-cite-3586">                 <span id="dsq-author-user-3586">Zach</span>             </cite>         </div>         <div id="dsq-comment-body-3586" class="dsq-comment-body">             <div id="dsq-comment-message-3586" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>God Bless the USA, the gun-carrying law-abiding citizens, and the men and women who protect and fight for those rights every day.</p> </div>         </div>     </li><!-- #comment-## -->     <li class="comment odd alt thread-odd thread-alt depth-1" id="dsq-comment-3600">         <div id="dsq-comment-header-3600" class="dsq-comment-header">             <cite id="dsq-cite-3600">                 <span id="dsq-author-user-3600">Wiegandrichardson</span>             </cite>         </div>         <div id="dsq-comment-body-3600" class="dsq-comment-body">             <div id="dsq-comment-message-3600" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>what does a green state mean</p> </div>         </div>     <ul class="children">     <li class="comment even depth-2" id="dsq-comment-3612">         <div id="dsq-comment-header-3612" class="dsq-comment-header">             <cite id="dsq-cite-3612">                 <span id="dsq-author-user-3612">1911colt</span>             </cite>         </div>         <div id="dsq-comment-body-3612" class="dsq-comment-body">             <div id="dsq-comment-message-3612" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>that is the state you marked where you held your permit.</p> </div>         </div>     </li><!-- #comment-## --> </ul><!-- .children --> </li><!-- #comment-## -->     <li class="comment odd alt thread-even depth-1" id="dsq-comment-3676">         <div id="dsq-comment-header-3676" class="dsq-comment-header">             <cite id="dsq-cite-3676"> http://pulse.yahoo.com/_W7TALS3BRC7KZ2SOERFUHNA554                <span id="dsq-author-user-3676">X RIDER</span>             </cite>         </div>         <div id="dsq-comment-body-3676" class="dsq-comment-body">             <div id="dsq-comment-message-3676" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Hr 218 is a carry in all 50 states, is this addressed on this site?</p> </div>         </div>     <ul class="children">     <li class="comment even depth-2" id="dsq-comment-3697">         <div id="dsq-comment-header-3697" class="dsq-comment-header">             <cite id="dsq-cite-3697">                 <span id="dsq-author-user-3697">jigger</span>             </cite>         </div>         <div id="dsq-comment-body-3697" class="dsq-comment-body">             <div id="dsq-comment-message-3697" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>I don&#8217;t believe it&#8217;s actually &#8220;addressed&#8221; here, with exception to the comments.

Criminals don&#8217;t give a damn about the law, thats why they are criminals and if a cop (you, your son, daughter, cousin, 4th uncle twice removed&#8230;.whoever) makes a stop and its some jerk-off that just knocked over a liqour store and has a 9mm hidden under the seat, they have the same chance they could get hurt as any other stop cause you just never know. BUT if I were a police officer and made a stop and found out the guy was carrying legally with a permit I would be just fine if not more comfortable with that. People need to understand that revoking gun rights anywhere either by state or federal law is a horrible idea cause it only makes it easier for CRIMINALS with no sense of law and order to do what they will and forces good clean law abiding citizens to have to make a choice of wether or not to follow the law and hope nothing ever happens or to they themselves carry a weapon illegally and possibly end up getting in a heap of trouble.

I for one agree that everyone has a choice to not enter and/or support a state that does not support the right for a person to defend themselves. I live in idaho, I have a idaho resident permit and will be getting a WA and possibly OR and UT permits which will pretty much open up my options for most of the places that I would ever travel. I don&#8217;t want to hurt anyone and hope I never get into a situation where I would have to use my weapon. But I do carry and like knowing that IF there ever was a time I would need it, i will have it and I personally wouldn&#8217;t travel through a state either that won&#8217;t let me carry my weapon on me ready to use if necessary. Then theres no reason to worry about lock boxes and other junk. And any state that would deny privledges (illinois) in my opinion are completely violating the constitution and have no business calling themselves a part of this country.

Really, do you live in a fantasy world? What gun do you have that you have to remove a &#8220;Clip&#8221; from? All the weapons I come across these days use a magazine.<br /> A clip is a device that is used to store multiple rounds of<br /> ammunition together as a unit, ready for insertion into the magazine or<br /> cylinder of a firearm.<br />  This speeds up the process of loading and reloading the firearm as<br /> several rounds can be loaded at once, rather than one round being loaded<br />  at a time. Several different types of clips exist, most of which are<br /> made of inexpensive metal stampings that are designed to be disposable,<br /> though they are often re-used.</p> <p>The term clip is commonly used to describe a firearm magazine,<br />  though this usage is technically incorrect. In the correct usage, a<br /> clip is used to feed a magazine or revolving cylinder, while a magazine<br /> or a belt is used to load cartridges into the chamber of a firearm</p> </div>         </div>     <ul class="children">     <li class="comment even depth-4" id="dsq-comment-4936">         <div id="dsq-comment-header-4936" class="dsq-comment-header">             <cite id="dsq-cite-4936">                 <span id="dsq-author-user-4936">zombiehiker</span>             </cite>         </div>         <div id="dsq-comment-body-4936" class="dsq-comment-body">             <div id="dsq-comment-message-4936" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Do you enjoy being a douche bag?</p> </div>         </div>     </li><!-- #comment-## -->     <li class="comment odd alt depth-4" id="dsq-comment-4954">         <div id="dsq-comment-header-4954" class="dsq-comment-header">             <cite id="dsq-cite-4954">                 <span id="dsq-author-user-4954">Seriously</span>             </cite>         </div>         <div id="dsq-comment-body-4954" class="dsq-comment-body">             <div id="dsq-comment-message-4954" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>what a dick bag. geez.</p> </div>         </div>     <ul class="children">     <li class="comment even depth-5" id="dsq-comment-4958">         <div id="dsq-comment-header-4958" class="dsq-comment-header">             <cite id="dsq-cite-4958">                 <span id="dsq-author-user-4958">Ejoz</span>             </cite>         </div>         <div id="dsq-comment-body-4958" class="dsq-comment-body">             <div id="dsq-comment-message-4958" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Too funny</p> </div>         </div>     </li><!-- #comment-## -->     <li class="comment odd alt depth-5" id="dsq-comment-5186">         <div id="dsq-comment-header-5186" class="dsq-comment-header">             <cite id="dsq-cite-5186"> http://www.facebook.com/unholyguy                <span id="dsq-author-user-5186">Bobby Dawson</span>             </cite>         </div>         <div id="dsq-comment-body-5186" class="dsq-comment-body">             <div id="dsq-comment-message-5186" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>not everyone likes a smart ass, dick bag. lol</p> </div>         </div>     </li><!-- #comment-## -->     <li class="comment even depth-5" id="dsq-comment-5395">         <div id="dsq-comment-header-5395" class="dsq-comment-header">             <cite id="dsq-cite-5395">                 <span id="dsq-author-user-5395">Smrtyguy</span>             </cite>         </div>         <div id="dsq-comment-body-5395" class="dsq-comment-body">             <div id="dsq-comment-message-5395" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>i read magazines and load clips-i&#8217;ve spent 30 years in law enforcement, including guarding the president, and am police certified in two states.  several years ago, i pulled into a rest area, east of tallahassie, florida, late at night.  about 2 hours after i left, the news on the radio said that 2 german tourists at that rest area were shot and killed.  i called the officer in charge and he told me that the reason they didn&#8217;t target me was that i didn&#8217;t fit their profile.  i also had my s&amp;w 327 and that was before concealed carry.  i&#8217;m a concealed carry instructor for oklahoma and am planning a trip to california, soon.  will i have my weapon, you bet.  last summer, a friend of mine was shot in the head at a ca. rest area by a guy looking for cigarettes.  fortunately, he survived.  you never know when you are gonna need it.  rather be in jail on a gun charge than in the morgue.</p> </div>         </div>     </li><!-- #comment-## -->     <li class="comment odd alt depth-5" id="dsq-comment-15205">         <div id="dsq-comment-header-15205" class="dsq-comment-header">             <cite id="dsq-cite-15205">                 <span id="dsq-author-user-15205">cawpin</span>             </cite>         </div>         <div id="dsq-comment-body-15205" class="dsq-comment-body">             <div id="dsq-comment-message-15205" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>&#8220;i read magazines and load clips-i&#8217;ve spent 30 years in law enforcement,&#8221;</p> <p>If that last part is true, we&#8217;re in a sad state of affairs.

When my Sheriff greatly liberalized the critieria for a CCW, as a police officer, I was concerned that we&#8217;d get some stupid behavior by gun toting  hot dogs. Fact was, we did not see one out of a thousand permits mis-used. If there was some quetionable judgement- the Sheriff pulled the permit and required the permitee to justify the behavior. That&#8217;s more control than the anti-gunners have&#8230;and it doesn&#8217;t create criminals- something Illinois has enough of despite their visionary gun policies. Those folks can&#8217;t get a Governor that stays out of jail.</p> </div>         </div>     </li><!-- #comment-## -->     <li class="comment even thread-even depth-1" id="dsq-comment-4553">         <div id="dsq-comment-header-4553" class="dsq-comment-header">             <cite id="dsq-cite-4553">                 <span id="dsq-author-user-4553">Luisetgt</span>             </cite>         </div>         <div id="dsq-comment-body-4553" class="dsq-comment-body">             <div id="dsq-comment-message-4553" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Traveling from michigan to texas how can I carry gun with my CPL?</p> </div>         </div>     </li><!-- #comment-## -->     <li class="comment odd alt thread-odd thread-alt depth-1" id="dsq-comment-4559">         <div id="dsq-comment-header-4559" class="dsq-comment-header">             <cite id="dsq-cite-4559">                 <span id="dsq-author-user-4559">Cobeone1</span>             </cite>         </div>         <div id="dsq-comment-body-4559" class="dsq-comment-body">             <div id="dsq-comment-message-4559" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>are there states that allow you to only open carry but do not let you conceal</p> </div>         </div>     <ul class="children">     <li class="comment even depth-2" id="dsq-comment-6216">         <div id="dsq-comment-header-6216" class="dsq-comment-header">             <cite id="dsq-cite-6216">                 <span id="dsq-author-user-6216">StoutCortez</span>             </cite>         </div>         <div id="dsq-comment-body-6216" class="dsq-comment-body">             <div id="dsq-comment-message-6216" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Wisconsin was like that before it went &#8220;shall issue&#8221;

 Everything he found out that he *wasn&#8217;t* gonna be allowed to do with a C.C. permit p!ssed him off &#8211; or so it seemed.  Needless to say, he was excused from the class about half-way thru it &#8211; no refund!

While there is a Federal Law that protects you while transporting your weapon from The state you are legal in and the state you are going that you will be Legal in, it is up to each state as to weather they honor that Federal Law or not.   I Recently needed to go through California on my way to Oregon, so I contacted CHP.  I own a Taurus Judge, which I had heard was considered an Assault Weapon in California, and therefore illegal.  I was told by CHP, that, regardless of the Federal Laws, if I was stopped for some reason and my weapon was found, locked or not, that it was up to the individual Officer.  I would most likely be charged with a Felony, regardless of the fact that There is a Federal Law protecting me to transport from My previous state to Oregon.  So best bet, contact the State Police / Highway Patrol of each state you plan to drive through.</p> </div>         </div>     </li><!-- #comment-## -->     <li class="comment odd alt thread-odd thread-alt depth-1" id="dsq-comment-5329">         <div id="dsq-comment-header-5329" class="dsq-comment-header">             <cite id="dsq-cite-5329">                 <span id="dsq-author-user-5329">Mike67857</span>             </cite>         </div>         <div id="dsq-comment-body-5329" class="dsq-comment-body">             <div id="dsq-comment-message-5329" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>I do not understand why (for example) indiana honors almost every other states permit but indiana permits are only honored by about 50% of the other states..

Once out of there I would file a class action law suit in federal court and finally let the SCOTUS give NYC and state a kick in the balls!</p> <p>I understand NY doesn&#8217;t follow the federal law in the lawful transportation of firearms in violation of 18 USC sub 926A &#8220;Interstate transportation of firearms<br /> Notwithstanding any other provision or rule or regulation of state or any political subdivision thereof, any person who is not otherwise prohibited by this chapter from transporting, shipping, or recieving a firearm shall be entitled to transport a firearm for any lawful purpose from any place he may lawfully possess and carry such firearm if, during such transportation the firearm is unloaded, and neither the firearm nor ammunition being transported is readily accessible or is directly accessible from the passenger compartment of such transporting vehicle, Provided, that in the case of a vehicle without a compartment separate from the driver&#8217;s compartment the firearm or ammunition shall be contained in a locked container other than the glove compartment or console&#8221;.</p> <p>Chicago&#8217;s democratic machine took one in the ass over their gun ban, DC got their balls handed to them, but still are circumventing the Ruling by Supreme court by making hard to get the safety class, cause it is against the law to have a gun store in dc and the list of &#8220;approved safety instructors is out dated or lacks proper contact info to go out side dc for class.</p> <p>He is correct where ever Democrats have gained a control, those are the states that you have to be a criminal to have a gun!  Some of the western states are a little different cause they were founded by rough and ready people and knew they needed guns to protect themselves and families.</p> <p>I would have filed complaint with the State Dept Natural resources because he is correct a resident that had a previous hunting license and is on active duty does not need to have a NYS big game tag or fishing license your active duty ID is sufficient unless the Democrats have infiltrated that part of government also.</p> <p>I will concede that not all democrats are bad but it seems the ones that want to infringe on many of our rights are the ones with the millions and the ability to bribe and buy the laws they want.  </p> <p>Obammma has already said he is going to circumvent the constitution if he wins again, he said he will use executive directives and orders to rule the country and bypass the legislative branch, the only good part about that is once a Republican hero is elected some time down the road he  can immediately rescind every executive order he has issued!<br /> Lets hope we have enough good Americans left that are moderate Democrats that will stand up to the rise of a dictatorial form of ruling from the White house!</p> </div>         </div>     </li><!-- #comment-## -->     <li class="comment even depth-5" id="dsq-comment-6218">         <div id="dsq-comment-header-6218" class="dsq-comment-header">             <cite id="dsq-cite-6218">                 <span id="dsq-author-user-6218">rstawarz11</span>             </cite>         </div>         <div id="dsq-comment-body-6218" class="dsq-comment-body">             <div id="dsq-comment-message-6218" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>whats your beef chump?20 years ago i moved to a free state that i dont need a judge to say if i can carry or not and i carry not because i want to br a big shot,i carry because here im a free man! my gripe is if i were to go to the place of my birth i would be considered a criminal,you see some states do not respect the constition and this is  what its about and if you knew who i really was you would be ashamed of yourself</p> </div>         </div>     </li><!-- #comment-## -->     <li class="comment odd alt depth-5" id="dsq-comment-9494">         <div id="dsq-comment-header-9494" class="dsq-comment-header">             <cite id="dsq-cite-9494">                 <span id="dsq-author-user-9494">Deigh</span>             </cite>         </div>         <div id="dsq-comment-body-9494" class="dsq-comment-body">             <div id="dsq-comment-message-9494" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>I feel sorry you.

I carry a .45 I decided to carry because my occupation brings me into hazardous situations. Im small business owner.For example. Due to a back injury I had to have one of my employees service a home which was in a high crime area. As I waited outside by my vehicle for my employee to finish a small gang war broke out 30 yards from me. I took cover behind my vehicle. This event basically made my decision easy. I have NEVER felt more helpless in my entire life.<br /> The very next day we went to service a local restaurant . It was early in the morning. We knocked. But no one answered. I pulled on the double doors which opened. I then called the owner to inform him the doors had been unlocked upon our arrival. He replied&#8230;&#8221; Oh ok I&#8217;m glad it&#8217;s you because the alarm was triggered I&#8217;m on my way . When the police get there tell them I&#8217;m on my way . FOURTY MINS LATER 15 minutes after the owner arrived. The police arrived. This is a small town people. The police station is 8 mins from our location driving the speed limit and hitting every red light. If this was a dangerous situation where the restaurant was being robbed the owner and employees had no chance. That day I finished my CCW paper work. Got printed and mailed it in. Today I don&#8217;t go ANYWHERE without my Glock 21 .45 caliber which I&#8217;ve become extremely proficient with by the way <img src="http://www.usacarry.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /></p> </div>         </div>     </li><!-- #comment-## -->     <li class="comment odd alt depth-5" id="dsq-comment-19643">         <div id="dsq-comment-header-19643" class="dsq-comment-header">             <cite id="dsq-cite-19643">                 <span id="dsq-author-user-19643">Laurence Almand</span>             </cite>         </div>         <div id="dsq-comment-body-19643" class="dsq-comment-body">             <div id="dsq-comment-message-19643" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Good for you, Bugman!

Bad enough you have to lie about facts, at least you could try not to get them bass-ackwards.  HERE are the actual, verifiable, facts on who used executive power how many times since 1960, in order of usage:  Clinton, 364;  Nixon, 346;  Johnson, 325;  Carter, 320; George W. Bush, 291; Kennedy, 214;  Obama, 182;  Ford, 169;  George H.W. Bush 166.  So which Bush are you talking about?  I have to assume you&#8217;re referring to George W. Bush, who used executive power 109 more times than Obama, who is only 8th on a list of 20 Presidents.  And Dubyuh&#8217;s dad, based on his record, if he&#8217;d won a second term. was on track to use it 332 times, which would have left Obama 9th on the list, ahead of only Ford, who was in office less than 3 years.</p> </div>         </div>     </li><!-- #comment-## -->     <li class="comment even depth-5" id="dsq-comment-22103">         <div id="dsq-comment-header-22103" class="dsq-comment-header">             <cite id="dsq-cite-22103">                 <span id="dsq-author-user-22103">patteeofurniture</span>             </cite>         </div>         <div id="dsq-comment-body-22103" class="dsq-comment-body">             <div id="dsq-comment-message-22103" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Simple, they don&#8217;t feel as threatened by the Dems in office.</p> </div>         </div>     </li><!-- #comment-## -->     <li class="comment odd alt depth-5" id="dsq-comment-22442">         <div id="dsq-comment-header-22442" class="dsq-comment-header">             <cite id="dsq-cite-22442">                 <span id="dsq-author-user-22442">Dave</span>             </cite>         </div>         <div id="dsq-comment-body-22442" class="dsq-comment-body">             <div id="dsq-comment-message-22442" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>How many of those embassy attacks have been blamed on an Internet video seen by thousands of muslims that are lucky to have electricity 1 hour a day and no running water.. must be magic laptops.</p> </div>         </div>     </li><!-- #comment-## -->     <li class="comment even depth-5" id="dsq-comment-22627">         <div id="dsq-comment-header-22627" class="dsq-comment-header">             <cite id="dsq-cite-22627">                 <span id="dsq-author-user-22627">Robin Hoodwinked</span>             </cite>         </div>         <div id="dsq-comment-body-22627" class="dsq-comment-body">             <div id="dsq-comment-message-22627" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>you left out the towers so not so accurate &#8212;- the problem comes from this country thinking it should police the world &#8212;&#8211; WWII was a catalyst to this way of thinking before then  the U S pretty much stayed isolated except for WWI which sprung the lock on the isolation door and how stupid was that war &#8212; over two idiot grade school minded aristocrats &#8212; no one should have fought that war &#8212;- but hey what do i know</p> </div>         </div>     </li><!-- #comment-## -->     <li class="comment odd alt depth-5" id="dsq-comment-22649">         <div id="dsq-comment-header-22649" class="dsq-comment-header">             <cite id="dsq-cite-22649">                 <span id="dsq-author-user-22649">Bush Wacker</span>             </cite>         </div>         <div id="dsq-comment-body-22649" class="dsq-comment-body">             <div id="dsq-comment-message-22649" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>The problem is Obama is the first president in 70 years to get an ambassador killed by his negligence in a terrorist attack.  This would not have been as bad if Obama Rice and Hillary had not tired to lie there way out of there incompetence blaming it on a video which had nothing to do with the attacks.  Add to that the folks in Benghazi begged for help and Obama refused to send any.   Anyone who says there was none is lying we have troops in Italy and Marines in the 6th fleet along with the battle group which always has an aircraft carrier and war planes which could have been there in the six hours these attacks occurred.   Where was he that night the news said he went to bed that is sure an example of the poor leadership this man has shown over the five years.  he was also neglect in not providing sufficient  security  not only that the Obama administration tried to remove what was there with an unstable government in charge.  Then he hung the Libyan prime mister out to dry by saying it was not a terrorist attack after the Prime Minister had publicly administered that.  With friends like Mr. Obama the man sure did not need any enemies around.</p> <p>Further what was every done to Hillary did obama call for her resignation as a leader would have no because he needed Bills support to stay in the white house. Then to add insult to injury he went to fund raiser instead of staying in Washington as he should have until the crisis ended he created through his inaction.  Then there was Hillary s &#8220;whats the difference&#8221;  and you democrats what<br /> this woman as your next presidential candidate you picked a real winner.<br />  there!!!</p> <p> Normally it is the host governments responsibility to protect an embassy the problem with Libya they still do not have a fully functioning government  Then like locking the door after the horses got stolen Obama sent Marines into Libya to protect the the embassy.   Normally they do not open an Embassy in a country which is still going through a civil war.    From what I am hearing from folks who are have been there the locals would like to have Gaddafi back.  Not because they liked his rule but at least the had order.</p> <p>If you had bothered to watch the congressional hearings when the Security offficer testified all the these facts were brought out.    The differance is you are to blinded by your Ideology to see the truth.  </p> <p>One other thing the worst Terrorist attack in our history was under Bill Clinton in Kenya can you see the Irony here another Democrat and that is where Obama&#8217;s  father came from.   </p> <p>Oh and one other thing about Regan he would have done something about it and in fact did Mr. Obama has yet to do anything.   Obama destabilize the entire middle east with his incompatible over the last five years.  Did it not seam strange to you when his guy from the Muslim brotherhood was thrown out how he wined about it.   It makes a rational person wonder where this mans loyalties really are.</p> </div>         </div>     </li><!-- #comment-## -->     <li class="comment even depth-5" id="dsq-comment-22717">         <div id="dsq-comment-header-22717" class="dsq-comment-header">             <cite id="dsq-cite-22717">                 <span id="dsq-author-user-22717">Gaius_Vindex</span>             </cite>         </div>         <div id="dsq-comment-body-22717" class="dsq-comment-body">             <div id="dsq-comment-message-22717" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Just wondering Joe&#8211;In how many of the terrorist attacks you cite, was the White House aware of the attack, in real time, lasting for &gt;8 hours, with rapid deployment forces ~90 minutes away (base in Sicily in the case of Benghazi) and did nothing?

I have told KKK members they need to get a life and quit living in the past, and unfortunately there are a lot of black americans who are doing the same. You try to blame all white americans for slavery, while actually a very low percentage of people owned slaves. But we all pay for the sins of our fathers. Mans iniquity against man has always been and always will be. But remember, blacks wasn&#8217;t the first and only slaves in America. Check your history and you will find that the Native American was the first slaves in North America, and there were many slaves of different types in South America. Even in mother Africa, villiages would take rival villagers and make slaves of them. At one time or another, we have all been slaves. What we should all be doing is coming together and trying to stop a runaway congress, senate, and an egotistic President that believes he is above the Constitution, and doesn&#8217;t answer to anyone but himself. Now should be a time of unity, not division. It seems pretty obvious to me that our Government has and is still controlling our concepts of one race against another. Lets break the pattern and elect real Constitutionalists to office. Then maybe we can get away from the status quo, and start on a road of healing.</p> </div>         </div>     </li><!-- #comment-## -->     <li class="comment odd alt depth-5" id="dsq-comment-20214">         <div id="dsq-comment-header-20214" class="dsq-comment-header">             <cite id="dsq-cite-20214">                 <span id="dsq-author-user-20214">christie</span>             </cite>         </div>         <div id="dsq-comment-body-20214" class="dsq-comment-body">             <div id="dsq-comment-message-20214" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>well put hoopcat</p> </div>         </div>     </li><!-- #comment-## -->     <li class="comment even depth-5" id="dsq-comment-20337">         <div id="dsq-comment-header-20337" class="dsq-comment-header">             <cite id="dsq-cite-20337">                 <span id="dsq-author-user-20337">Ted</span>             </cite>         </div>         <div id="dsq-comment-body-20337" class="dsq-comment-body">             <div id="dsq-comment-message-20337" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>The other part that seems to be conveniently ignored is that it was their own people, the blacks in Africa, who sold them as slaves in the first place.

WE aren&#8217;t like that at all. It is a simple truth in this beloved nation of ours (ALL OF US) that those states with a constitutional outlook on the 2nd Amendment have a much lower crime rate. Take Alaska, for example; EVERYONE up there carries a gun. They HAVE to, due mostly to the fact that it takes law enforcement (few and far between!) a long time to reach any emergency location, and a bear or a moose attack is a likelihood if you live anywhere west of Canada. Which is anywhere in Alaska. When I was there, I found wildlife at large in all the towns, on all roads, in all the streams and backyards&#8230; there&#8217;re more of THEM than there are of US!!! And in places on the southern border, there are fewer cops than you might think because they are almost all watching the illegals trudging north, and are all spread so thin they may as well not be there if you need an ambulance or have been mugged or  otherwise assaulted. What about the Bronx? I lived there for 20 years, and a more f**ked up place I will NEVER see&#8230; unless I move to Chicago. Can you think of a better way to stop the violence, a way better than letting ALL the law-abiding folks there carry lawfully obtained handguns? With BIG A*S magazines, 15 rounds or more to a clip? I can&#8217;t, and I was a cop for 28 years there.

When I moved to Greenwich Ct from NY City, I was amazed to meet all the New Yorkers who had moved up to Greenwich. GW is right on the NY/Conn border and is only about 20 minutes from the city border. I am a dyed-in-the-wool conservative and a Tea Partier, and I applied for a CCW as soon as I got there. I was amazed at all the damned liberals at the Representative Town Meeting (Town Council). And what were they doing? Complaining about the hunting regulations, and about the &#8220;redneck gun laws&#8221;. And I remember standing up and saying:&#8221;Since a lot of you paid over half a million for your homes, and some of you twice that amount, then why did you spend so much on homes in a place that you don&#8217;t like? You&#8217;ll NEVER change the hunting regs here. You will just have to live with them, and get smarter about posting your land. Live with what you got, not with &#8216;I want I want I want&#8217; &#8220;.<br />    I was applauded by every &#8220;townie&#8221; there. The &#8220;New Yorkers&#8221; mostly just got up and left.

My dad had long since given up hunting let alone owning a gun.  Thankfully, we were never robbed or attacked&#8230;that is, until my mom was mugged right in front of me in Alexandria, VA. by a black man.  He hit her in the face, knocked her to the ground and ran off with her purse.  She didn&#8217;t drive.  Living in relative safety in MA gave her a false sense of safety once we moved to Alexandria.  And add to it the liberal illusion of the &#8216;goodness of people&#8217; and other utopian nonsense led to her putting herself (not to mention ME) in harm&#8217;s way.

I live in Idaho. I was born and raised in NY City, and also spent 15 years in Connecticut. I went college and then law school for 3 years. I was hurt in the 9/11 debacle and was an Auxiliary Police Sergeant in the NYPD back then. Idaho may be full of very PROUD rednecks, if by &#8220;redneck&#8221; you are referring to the hard working men and women who work hard and play hard to live their lives free of the restraints placed on them by elitists such as yourself. My neighbor, a graduate of CalTech runs his own IT business from his farmhouse. Another friend of mine has three doctor of Theology degrees, one from Union Theological Seminary in NY City. He does a lot of on-line teaching on ancient religious sects and their impact on the development of Christianity and Judaism. Is this high-brow enough for you? My other neighbor graduated high school, runs a farm that was passed down to him by his father and their dad/granddad, and that farm is a multi-million dollar business. He runs it without any college degree at all. Pretty amazing, huh? And we all have those amazing red necks. I guess it comes from getting out of the house and actually doing SOMETHING other than just sitting on one&#8217;s computer and calling other people we don&#8217;t even know names. Do you feel better now? </p> <p>   Sorry, I can&#8217;t hear you.</p> </div>         </div>     </li><!-- #comment-## -->     <li class="comment odd alt depth-5" id="dsq-comment-19971">         <div id="dsq-comment-header-19971" class="dsq-comment-header">             <cite id="dsq-cite-19971">                 <span id="dsq-author-user-19971">Yaaqob Abrams</span>             </cite>         </div>         <div id="dsq-comment-body-19971" class="dsq-comment-body">             <div id="dsq-comment-message-19971" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>You are so full of S**t.

Now you can an &#8220;enhanced&#8221; Idaho permit, which should be recognized by more states beyond our borders (exc. Canada).  My CFP instructor said a year and half ago that most states were doing away with the live fire requirements, as that imputes some liability on the state&#8217;s part.  So (pre-enhanced permit), the instructors of these classes are also certified by the state of Utah, which issues permits to nonresidents.<br />    Firearms are tools, just like screwdrivers, hammers, knives, footballs, baseballs and bats.</p> </div>         </div>     </li><!-- #comment-## -->     <li class="comment odd alt depth-5" id="dsq-comment-16814">         <div id="dsq-comment-header-16814" class="dsq-comment-header">             <cite id="dsq-cite-16814">                 <span id="dsq-author-user-16814">Kevin</span>             </cite>         </div>         <div id="dsq-comment-body-16814" class="dsq-comment-body">             <div id="dsq-comment-message-16814" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Wish I knew what county.

The most consistently liberal state in the USA, Vermont, where a legit (self-described) democratic socialist is senator (Bernie Sanders), is the only state that has maintained unrestricted gun carry laws even before concealed carry became popular  </p> <p>&#8211; James Brady (RIP) (Brady Law) wasn&#8217;t a liberal. He took a bullet protecting President Reagan. </p> <p>&#8211; Just look at the map on this page and you can clearly see that most &#8220;blue states&#8221; permit concealed carry. And NY is not that liberal if you are judging libs to be Democrats and conservatives to be Republicans, </p> <p>&#8211; The truth is that most states are purple and they swing from red to blue, even Idaho and New York City. Hell, Staten Island is a staunch stronghold of the GOP.

I am the mother of 5, I know.  We all can say unwise things and make an unwise decision in a flash when faced with a difficult situation. I have done so myself. I once blamed myself for every bad choice my darlings made but no more. I worked diligently to teach them Bible principles now they are on their own. People who carry guns need to be balanced so to make a good decision during a bad situation. Can one do this and be as hot tempered as some of our ccw writers? I sense insecurity and that they might need a hug.

When I grew up a conservative looked out for his neighbor and understood that greed and exploitation are bad. Todays right wing has moved past conservative to regressive. Personally, I have no interest in going back to the segregated south or the expectation that women should be quiet, barefoot and pregnant in the kitchen.  I get the sense that the &#8220;no govt&#8221; plank of the party isn&#8217;t concerned about the consequences of rolling back the last century of laws that enabled a broadly successful free market by granting access to more of us. As corporations aggregate and consolidate power, the small business (and small town) is dying. Corporate greed is a bigger culprit than progressive vs. conservative, but they have us distracted by bickering with each other over birth control while they steal our country. </p> </div>         </div>     </li><!-- #comment-## -->     <li class="comment even depth-5" id="dsq-comment-10589">         <div id="dsq-comment-header-10589" class="dsq-comment-header">             <cite id="dsq-cite-10589">                 <span id="dsq-author-user-10589">Liz</span>             </cite>         </div>         <div id="dsq-comment-body-10589" class="dsq-comment-body">             <div id="dsq-comment-message-10589" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Yes, we must be focused on real issues at hand and in agreement when possible.

Think about it.</p> </div>         </div>     </li><!-- #comment-## -->     <li class="comment odd alt depth-5" id="dsq-comment-9481">         <div id="dsq-comment-header-9481" class="dsq-comment-header">             <cite id="dsq-cite-9481">                 <span id="dsq-author-user-9481">bob</span>             </cite>         </div>         <div id="dsq-comment-body-9481" class="dsq-comment-body">             <div id="dsq-comment-message-9481" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>You are correct Sir!</p> </div>         </div>     </li><!-- #comment-## -->     <li class="comment even depth-5" id="dsq-comment-11612">         <div id="dsq-comment-header-11612" class="dsq-comment-header">             <cite id="dsq-cite-11612"> http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=722136046                <span id="dsq-author-user-11612">Daniel Stoner</span>             </cite>         </div>         <div id="dsq-comment-body-11612" class="dsq-comment-body">             <div id="dsq-comment-message-11612" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>You just said 2 contradictory things, one true and one dead wrong:  &#8220;Pick someone and stand by your vote&#8221;  &#8211; truer words never spoken.

Yes, let the government control everything, and we&#8217;ll all be safe and secure. Our nanny and big brother will tuck us in every night as we have blithely float through life in this brave new world. Trust your political leaders to the point of prostration and worship, as long as we can still suckle at the government teat. There will never come a time when we will ever have to defend ourselves. A handgun, an assault rifle, a machine gun, a surface-to-air missile, a tank, yes, of course those should only be in the hands of professionals. Not ordinary citizens. Goodness, most of the plebs aren&#8217;t &#8211; what&#8217;s the word? &#8211; Responsible? Intelligent? Powerful? &#8211; Hmm? What is the word that the general, average, law abiding citizen isn&#8217;t enough of to not be allowed to own every type of weapons (barring those pesky, and oh-so-elusive WWMD&#8217;s) the military or law enforcement is allowed to use? I just can&#8217;t think of it. Weird. Freedom, it may be cliche, but it isn&#8217;t free, and being free is risky sometimes. This 230-something-year-old experiment is a risk. Driving down the road every day is a risk. A far more dangerous risk per capita that losing your life to gun violence. Should we ban cars and trucks, and everybody just rides mass transit? Maybe? Hunh? (I can just see some socialist troglodyte drafting the insipid bill now, so he can slip it surreptitiously in the Congressional hopper at the end of a midnight session.) Living life is scary and sometimes dangerous, but mostly it&#8217;s banal, but sometimes, on rare brilliant occasions it&#8217;s glorious. Worth protecting from all threats, both from within and without. At all times and in all places. Every citizen who had the strength and inclination to safeguard the heath, welfare, prosperity and happiness they and their loved ones have earned through sweat, blood, and tears, well, shouldn&#8217;t be allowed to do so? Just my not-so-humble opinion. Flames welcome from all you flamers. Heh.

Without limitations, without restrictions! Had our neighbors really felt free enough to be armed in a city with a propensity to restrict private gun owners and concealed carry, responsible action would have been taken to at least prevented the incident from occurring or may have stopped it in the act. Having spent several years as a police officer and over fifteen years in the US Army, I have been exceptionally trained and what dismays me the most, it took the the Gary PD over nine minutes to respond.

This is because  the people , the regular citizens, the  grocery clerk, the car mechanic, the landscaper the carpenter,  become the citizen  militia,  the last defense against  foreign invaders   or   a  government headed to tyranny.  Whenever  the gov  wants to restrict certain handguns  or rifles to only military and/or  law enforcement,   they are  infringing on the  2nd amendment rights  main purpose for existing,   The 2nd amendment was not for sport shooting for hobby or hunting,  sport shooting is just a way to practice and hunting works as well with a bow and arrow.   The 2nd amendment was so the people could defend against military threats whether foreign or domestic.

Look at 9/11 &#8211; a perfect example.  Not a single gun used; bin Laden attacked the WTC due to Western occupation of lands holy to Islam.  This is exactly the type of unconventional asymmetrical warfare that is used today.  Bin Laden could have sent a Muslim with a gun to the WTC &amp; had them go nuts, firing into a crowd, but do you think it really would produce the same wrenching affect for Americans as flying 747s into two symbols of western economic power and killing several thousand people still does to this day?  I&#8217;m completely opposed to banning guns or severely controlling them, but I don&#8217;t see them as a crucial asset for asymmetrical tactics that are more effective than anything an armed militia could come up with.</p> </div>         </div>     </li><!-- #comment-## -->     <li class="comment even depth-5" id="dsq-comment-12841">         <div id="dsq-comment-header-12841" class="dsq-comment-header">             <cite id="dsq-cite-12841">                 <span id="dsq-author-user-12841">Gandalf</span>             </cite>         </div>         <div id="dsq-comment-body-12841" class="dsq-comment-body">             <div id="dsq-comment-message-12841" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Here&#8217;s the difference.  Millions of guns and hundreds of millions of rounds of ammunition are all ready out there, in the hands of the people.  Whether &#8220;the people&#8221; know it or not, they are an available paramilitary resource that can be called upon if necessary to resist a foreing invader, or can also be (if they have the will) assembled and used to resist a domestic government bent upon tyranny.<br /> On the other hand, explosives are tightly monitored, controlled, and in many cases chemically &#8220;tagged&#8221; so that they can be traced.  The  &#8220;explosives&#8221; used in the WTC attack were aircraft commandeered by hijackers. and with all the new so-called security and domestic spying laws (yes, I said domestic spying&#8230;don&#8217;t kid youself that it&#8217;s anything else) now in place, repeating this type of attack is much more difficult).  I&#8217;m willing to bet that the government is a heck of a lot more worried about the millions of firearms out here in civilian hands (many of which are untraceable because they were acquired privately without forms, background checks etc) than they are about some future &#8220;unibomber&#8221; &#8211; types with a car bomb which would be few and far between.  This is as it should be.  The government should be scared of the people.  It&#8217;s a Hell of a lot better for the people that way than the other way around.  If you don&#8217;t believe that, just ask the German Jews massacred by the Nazis, or the Cambodians who suffered and were butchered under Pol Pot&#8217;s regime&#8230;Oh wait, you  can&#8217;t:  there all dead; millions of them.  Wonder if any of them would have liked a chance to at least go down fighting with an &#8220;evil gun&#8221; in their hands and a &#8220;2nd Ammendment&#8221; that would have helped protect their right to live.  Yeah, I know, it can&#8217;t happen here; this is America.  I&#8217;m sure there were lots of Romans who believe that as well&#8230;right up to the point where the barbarians began sacking the city.  Several other civilizations/empires probably fealt that way too and, like the Romans, they&#8217;re long dead, too.<br /> Contrast the long dead civilizations above with the Swiss who&#8217;ve remained armed, neutral and FREE for over a thousand years.  What do they know that our modern day anti-gun types don&#8217;t?  Be honest with yourself and you&#8217;ll see the answer.  But, here&#8217;s the answer on Swiss citizen-soldier gave.  While observing Swiss military maneuvers, the German Kaiser once remarked to a Swiss soldier(I&#8217;m paraphrasing, now), &#8220;Your military is impresssive; highly motivated and well trained.  However, you are only  500,000.  What will you do if we Germans attack with a million men? &#8221;  The Swiss soldier thought for second and then replied, &#8220;We will shoot twice and then go home.&#8221;  If you can understand the motivation of that Swiss soldier, you can understand why we need the 2nd Ammendment.  If you cannot, then you will never &#8220;get it&#8221;.</p> </div>         </div>     </li><!-- #comment-## -->     <li class="comment odd alt depth-5" id="dsq-comment-13434">         <div id="dsq-comment-header-13434" class="dsq-comment-header">             <cite id="dsq-cite-13434">                 <span id="dsq-author-user-13434">JRedHorse</span>             </cite>         </div>         <div id="dsq-comment-body-13434" class="dsq-comment-body">             <div id="dsq-comment-message-13434" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Excellent  post! and may I add another race of people destroyed because we were disarmed first ,my ancestors The Native Americans!<br /> The Government disarmed us once but it will NOT happen again because we now teach all our young people how to handle and use fire arms for hunting and self preservation.<br /> Thank you for a clear thinking view on a great subject!</p> </div>         </div>     </li><!-- #comment-## -->     <li class="comment even depth-5" id="dsq-comment-14534">         <div id="dsq-comment-header-14534" class="dsq-comment-header">             <cite id="dsq-cite-14534"> http://www.facebook.com/people/Ra-Hensel/1807876924                <span id="dsq-author-user-14534">R.a.

The shop was full of customers and a uniformed officer was standing at the counter. Upon seeing the officer, the would-be robber announced a hold-up and fired a few wild shots from a target pistol.<br /> The officer and a clerk promptly returned fire, and several customers also drew their guns and fired. The robber was pronounced dead at the scene by Paramedics. Crime scene investigators located 47 expended cartridge cases in the shop. The subsequent autopsy revealed 23 gunshot wounds.

General Ghiapp, in his memoirs, (Ghiapp was Ho Chi Minh&#8217;s brilliant strategist during the wars in Vietnam. Yup, there was more than one!) wrote 2 telling things. The first was that if only 10% of the population would fight, but the other 90% would support them, no power could ever defeat a guerilla force. He also asked why, after the horrible defeat of the North Vietnamese Army in the Tet offensive of 1968, did the United States give up? The pussies in D.C. would never allow a new American War for Independence to last long, and they&#8217;d throw in the towel.

I enlisted in 1963.<br /> In boot camp, I was trained on both the 1911 colt 45, and the<br /> Springfield Arms 30-06 M1 Girand.  I currently own modified<br /> versions of both of those types of weapons.<br /> The reality is that when I now take those two types of weapons<br /> to the range I probably fire more rounds in one or two days<br /> than I did firing them during my entire time in service to the<br /> US Navy.<br /> I try to rotate my time at the range between my weapons so I<br /> can maintain at least some degree of proficiency with them all.<br /> My first firearm was an old octagon barrel Winchester pump<br /> 22 caliber that my dad gave me as protection from bobcats<br /> and cougars while I was in the woods that surrounded our<br /> property.  I was 11 years old then. My father (also ex WWII<br /> Navy plus a pre WWII stint in the Coast Guard) taught me<br /> weapon safety, and handling starting at about age 5.</p> </div>         </div>     </li><!-- #comment-## -->     <li class="comment odd alt depth-5" id="dsq-comment-17480">         <div id="dsq-comment-header-17480" class="dsq-comment-header">             <cite id="dsq-cite-17480">                 <span id="dsq-author-user-17480">NJHuguenot</span>             </cite>         </div>         <div id="dsq-comment-body-17480" class="dsq-comment-body">             <div id="dsq-comment-message-17480" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Being a SEABEE was different since we are organized more like infantry battalions.(Marines with trades)  As an electrician I was assigned to Bravo Company with the Utilitiesmen and we are a small arms company.

I have a few .40s(M&amp;P) and an AR15. The wife and I go to the range at least every two months. I was in 1971-1975. The only gun was my grandfather&#8217;s. He was a bear hunter. I think  my aunt got it since she was still living near hom when he passed. I&#8217;m thinking of getting a pump shotgun. It&#8217;s the only thing I haven&#8217;t really had much experience with.

Hopefully, on November 6th, a sea change will occur, and worries about Federally owned armored vehicles will be allayed. Its much better to effect change using the ballot box, not the bullet box, and far less bloody.<br /> Patriots have, in my never humble opinion, a duty to maintain arms, ammo, and equipment suitable for military purposes.

If you haven&#8217;t noticed, which obviously you haven&#8217;t if you really believe what you said, almost all of the current administration is anti-gun (anti 2nd amendment) with the exception of, ironically, Harry Reid.  Of course he&#8217;s screwed up on so many levels it makes up for it.  If this administration is retained, next year at this time you&#8217;ll be living in the United Socialists States of America.  Like some have said, this is not the Democratic party of even 50 years ago.  How can Democrats be so oblivious to what Obama stands for?  It&#8217;s not like he hides it.  He told us about it before he was ever elected.  But some chose to ignor it because they disliked Bush.  News flash, Bush wasn&#8217;t running again.  Wake up before it&#8217;s too late.

Here in PA, we have a statutory Firearms Preemptions Law that prevents local municipalities, boros, unicorporated areas, or even big cities from passing their own laws. Philadelphia has been spanked several times for throwing their weight around on this, and the last time it cost them 25 grand. Not a lot of money, of course, but its the principle of the Preemption statute. I would suggest you look into passing the same into law in New York. It could keep guys like Cuomo and Bloomberg at bay.</p> </div>         </div>     </li><!-- #comment-## -->     <li class="comment odd alt depth-5" id="dsq-comment-17082">         <div id="dsq-comment-header-17082" class="dsq-comment-header">             <cite id="dsq-cite-17082">                 <span id="dsq-author-user-17082">William Bennett</span>             </cite>         </div>         <div id="dsq-comment-body-17082" class="dsq-comment-body">             <div id="dsq-comment-message-17082" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>I obviously can&#8217;t speak for Mike, but I am also a NYS resident and have had my unrestricted permit since 1987.

I hate to say it but with the World going crazy, when I go into WA, I make darn sure my &#8220;secret&#8221; hiding place can&#8217;t be found unless a police dog trained to sniff out weapons is with the officer.

In Florida, when I applied for a CCW, I had to submit prints, take a safety course, pay a fee, and wait.

Nearly all require fingerprints at a minimum.  Frankly, it disturbs me a bit that any jurisdiction would issue someone a CCW permit that is good for life&#8230;after all, who is to say that your mental capacity hasn&#8217;t deteriorated due to age, illness or other circumstances since you got that permit 35 years ago?

So far as fake I.D., we have a larger issue at the polls than with License to Carry Firearms. One must consider that in any shooting, God forbid it happens that any of us must use lethal force, there will be a hard look taken at the shooting by investigators, District Attorneys, and others in Law Enforcement. Just because Pennsylvanians have a Constitutional Right, we must all exercise prudence and responsibility. When I am out and about and well heeled, my radar is tuned to a higher frequency, and I recognize that if I&#8217;m not under IMMINENT danger of grave bodily injury or death, its far better to retire and live to fight another day. Of course I&#8217;m old, have a couple of fractured teeth and fingers from my younger days, and have learned to tolerate and avoid morons when possible.<br /> So far as open carry, I do respect anyone&#8217;s right to strap on a blaster and go about their daily chores. Personally, I don&#8217;t care to draw that much attention to myself. I do, from time to time, carry openly, especially in our beautiful woods and forests. Sometimes, though, in foul weather, I cover my sidearm with a jacket. Strangely, at that moment, I must possess a license, as the sidearm is concealed. Pennsylvania is working hard to adopt Constitutional Carry, and to clarify Transportation of Firearms.<br /> Keep working on your Legislature in Texas. Open carry isn&#8217;t off the table so long as you keep fighting for it.</p> </div>         </div>     </li><!-- #comment-## --> </ul><!-- .children --> </li><!-- #comment-## -->     <li class="comment even depth-4" id="dsq-comment-14737">         <div id="dsq-comment-header-14737" class="dsq-comment-header">             <cite id="dsq-cite-14737">                 <span id="dsq-author-user-14737">Pete C</span>             </cite>         </div>         <div id="dsq-comment-body-14737" class="dsq-comment-body">             <div id="dsq-comment-message-14737" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>You sir, could not be more wrong.

I also lived in New York, down in the city and I was there for 36 years. As an Auxiliary Sergeant with the NYPD I was actually refused a Premises/Target Permit because &#8220;of the risk that I might (MIGHT) carry my gun concealed while on duty&#8221;. Now let&#8217;s get this straight; I&#8217;m an Auxiliary Police Supervisor, uniform, shield, ID and radio, and Peace Officer registration to go with the training (although that status is denied by the brass at 1 Police Plaza) and I can&#8217;t get a license for a handgun because some paranoid moron in the licensing bureau fears that I MIGHT, MAYBE, POSSIBLY carry concealed a handgun while in my uniform and on duty. Aux P/Os cannot carry on duty even if they are peace officers in their regular jobs with permission to pack on their job. But here in Idaho, my Enhanced Permit (renewed every 5 years) is accepted in 34 states now as a CCW permit. How many states accept your &#8220;license for life&#8221; from New York? I&#8217;ll save you the trouble: just 20 states that choose to recognize NY State&#8217;s permit. And they all accept every state&#8217;s permit. Even Idaho. New York&#8217;s permit system and the accompanying psycho-babble justifying it is just excuse-ology meant to hamstring as many people as can be forbidden from actually owning any firearms at all. Pap, I say. Oh, I agree about the mentally ill and very young children, but some felons, SOME (not all) should have their rights returned to them due to the non-violent nature of their crimes. My own brother is one. For 40 years he&#8217;s been forbidden from owning or possessing firearms or projectile weapons of any kind or variety due to a stupid thing he did of a completely non-violent nature when he was 19. There is little rhyme or reason to this &#8220;system&#8221;. It&#8217;s time all the 50 states and all of the territories and commonwealths started recognizing each others permits and licenses, just as the Constitution says we all have to do as per Article IV, section 1 is to &#8220;respect the public acts, records and judicial proceedings of every other state&#8221;.  The Full Faith and Credit Clause is one of THE most important Articles of the Constitution because it sets the basic tone of the interrelationships between the &#8220;various states&#8221;.

There&#8217;s a reason why your state has a high crime rate. You jackasses think that if you take the guns out of people&#8217;s hands that crime will go away. HA!! All you did is create and foster a state full of victims. Now instead of the LAW abiding citizens being able to defend and fight back against the criminals, to include your f*!cked up Police forces, you have made a gun-free zone or as I like to call it a criminal playground. Does everybody have the right to bear arms? Yes. The Consitiution doesn&#8217;t say unless you&#8217;re blah blah blah. See the idea behind it was that if you have a criminal that&#8217;s convicted, he stays convicted and in jail. He serves his time or dies, which ever come first. As far as children go, it was a way of life and they were taught at an early age how to handle and shoot a weapon. Mine don&#8217;t even have a curiousity anymore. It is your responsibility as a parent to teach your children. I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;re going to spout off with some liberal hate BS and some untruth about some fact that doesn&#8217;t exist, so let me stop you right there. The fact of the matter is, the states, cities, towns with more guns in the hands of citizens, the less crime there is. I&#8217;ll spare you the other half since I am sure you&#8217;re smart enough to figure out what the opposite is.</p> </div>         </div>     </li><!-- #comment-## -->     <li class="comment odd alt depth-4" id="dsq-comment-20306">         <div id="dsq-comment-header-20306" class="dsq-comment-header">             <cite id="dsq-cite-20306">                 <span id="dsq-author-user-20306">granny</span>             </cite>         </div>         <div id="dsq-comment-body-20306" class="dsq-comment-body">             <div id="dsq-comment-message-20306" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>They also do the fingerprint check in Michigan, doctors letter stating that we are of sound mind.

Most, in fact I believe all of them nowadays, run fingerprints through the FBI before issuing concealed carry permits.  This has been the case since at least the late 1990s.  NY, like many East Coast states (CT, DC, MA, MD, RI) just does not recognize permits from ANY other state, even ones that are as strict on checking as NY is.  For example, CT, which is not recognized by NY, and also does not recognize NY,  requires a permit from your local city police, who run the FBI fingerprint check, before you can even apply for a state permit.  The 2 states I have permits in now, Utah and Nevada, run the prints, and Nevada requires passing an all day handgun course and an actual shooting test.  NY just doesn&#8217;t like civilians having handguns (nor does CT).  Northeast states, in general, just don&#8217;t like citizens to be armed.  I NY I was literally laughed at in the early &#8217;70s when I asked to apply for a permit at the Schenectady PD, and in CT 3 years later the city PD said not to bother applying, they wouldn&#8217;t approve it, and a year after that I was a city cop, working for that very same PD.  There was obviously nothing wrong with me or my background.  Then I went myself to the state HQ in Wallingford to get a state permit  (In CT even a sworn law enforcement officer couldn&#8217;t legally carry outside his jurisdiction unless he had a state permit), and they said I didn&#8217;t have a good enough reason; I&#8217;d put &#8220;self defense&#8221; just to see what would happen, but they suddenly changed their mind when I showed them my badge and ID.</p> </div>         </div>     </li><!-- #comment-## -->     <li class="comment odd alt depth-4" id="dsq-comment-22558">         <div id="dsq-comment-header-22558" class="dsq-comment-header">             <cite id="dsq-cite-22558">                 <span id="dsq-author-user-22558">ed</span>             </cite>         </div>         <div id="dsq-comment-body-22558" class="dsq-comment-body">             <div id="dsq-comment-message-22558" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Pa also requires fingerprints, still no reciprocity.</p> </div>         </div>     </li><!-- #comment-## -->     <li class="comment even depth-4" id="dsq-comment-22671">         <div id="dsq-comment-header-22671" class="dsq-comment-header">             <cite id="dsq-cite-22671">                 <span id="dsq-author-user-22671">NavyGunner</span>             </cite>         </div>         <div id="dsq-comment-body-22671" class="dsq-comment-body">             <div id="dsq-comment-message-22671" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Back in the day, convicted felons, mentally incompetent, and underage, were not considered citizens, merely residents.

And the only two states out here in the Northwestern US that do not recognize our permits are the only two states that recognize NO other state; they are California and Oregon. There are more states like mine, and New York has only recently received recognition for their permit from these other states. New York has been behind the eight ball for many years with these legal squabbles going on over there. And I say all these things as a native born New Yorker from Manhattan, aka New York County. The Original New York City. And having served there as an UNARMED Auxiliary Police Officer, I can tell you, Never Again. I&#8217;d rather move to one of the 5 states that now have Constitutional Carry. There&#8217;s one directly next door to you all over there; that&#8217;s Vermont. Since the days of the American Revolution, there has been no law concerning the carriage of any firearm, either openly or concealed; long gun or handgun.

Why should someone have to be 21? I was drafted shortly after my 20th birthday and only maneuvering by politicians prevented me going when I was 19. About 25,000 KIAs  in Vietnam were 20 years old or less. So 21 is a stupid age limit. If a person has no felony record why should they they NOT be granted a CCW even if 18? How can the Gov&#8217;t say that an 18 year old cannot  possess a handgun when they will ISSUE him  a machine gun to blow peoples guts out in a combat zone? Along with handgrenades, Claymore mines and other tools of the trade.  If someone is old enough to die in combat he is old enough to have full citizenship. Yet since Montana does not kow tow to some states onerous and arbitrary requirements I can&#8217;t carry in the state I was drafted from to go off to VN where I was carrying a belt-fed machinegun before I was 21. I smuggeld a LW Commander to VN in a shaving kit but my dad had to buy it for me. I was plenty old enough to die for my country but could not buy a handgun. Stupid.

Some slightly, others drastically.  You really need to know these differences from one state to another. Maybe not just passing through, but if you are relocating..absolutely.  An example is..The castle doctrine, some have some don&#8217;t, all are different. In NC you can NEVER use deadly force to protect property or animals period, in Texas, a neighbor can use deadly force to protect a neighbor&#8217;s property without the element of Immanent threat of death, serious bodily injury, or sexual assault.  Although I strongly agree with Texas and believe the B and E rate would drop if we all that that, try that in NC and the good guy goes to jail, or at least gets charged.  The list goes on.

Not Relevant Anymore is an impediment to resolving gun issues. They have no vested interest in true solutions, but rather in delaying progress. Note their huge board of directors, Pepe LePew&#8217;s obscene salary, and here in Pennsylvania, nearly 9 years of obstructing the vote on our Castle Doctrine (Act 10). I dumped NRA this year, after decades as a voting member. For a real treat, to to Heave-Ho Hohenwarter (John Hohenwarter is the unwelcome NRA liaison officer for Pennsylvania, New Hampshire, and I believe 5 other states). He is an arrogant ass, and the face of  the NRA for us. When NRA called to ask me to renew, I told them, Heave Ho Hohenwarter and I&#8217;m back in.

I think it stinks; I am an American, not just a Pennsylvanian, Washingtonian, Utahn, Vermonter, etc. It also means I end up paying hundreds of dollars a year to multiple states effectively to be in a FEDERAL database that does no more than document that I am law abiding and have been all my life.</p> <p>I also believe that the Constitution is my carry permit, so I resent being required to have to license my carry anyway!

And bad people do bad things with those technologies as well. </p> <p>In my experience, radical anti-gun people are a) clueless about firearms and b) mentally immature: they have rejected mature tool use and adult self sufficiency in favor of&#8230;I&#8217;m not even sure what.

Will someone tell me how any law maker can<br /> prove that any law or required permit when it comes to guns will stop the bad<br /> guy? The other day I saw a sign outside an indoor mall that read, “No Firearms Allowed<br /> Inside”. Who is that an invitation for? If it instead had read, “All Store Venders<br /> inside Are CCW Certified and Armed”.  I,<br /> as a shopper would have felt better, but I think the bad guy might reconsider. We<br /> all have heard about the schools, fast food places, postal service, airplanes,<br /> ships and even churches where mass killings have taken place; but extremely<br /> rare, is it that anyone has tried it in a police station. Could it be because<br /> people there have guns and will use them? I heard somewhere that DC has the<br /> highest murder crime rate in the US, yet they have the strictest gun control<br /> laws; if that is true or even close; how’s that working for them. I&#8217;m one of those who will not intentionally break the law. The concern I have is that one day, me, someone I love, or don&#8217;t even know will be injured or even killed; because I obeyed the law.<br /> JM</p> </div>         </div>     </li><!-- #comment-## -->     <li class="comment even thread-even depth-1" id="dsq-comment-5688">         <div id="dsq-comment-header-5688" class="dsq-comment-header">             <cite id="dsq-cite-5688">                 <span id="dsq-author-user-5688">Andy</span>             </cite>         </div>         <div id="dsq-comment-body-5688" class="dsq-comment-body">             <div id="dsq-comment-message-5688" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>I don&#8217;t get it&#8230;South Dakota recognizes Minn. resident permit but Minn. doesn&#8217;t recognize South Dakota resident permit.

You CCW holders there in Ohio could help this problem by telling your local and state Government how you feel. Many of us Here in Indiana have tried and now are asking for are state to not honor the states that don&#8217;t us. And though this is against the 2nd Amendment which we feel so strongly about. we got to get are message across, So again maybe with the help of all you we can get this solved. If you notice Indiana is one state that honor&#8217;s across the map.</p> <p>Thank you C.J. from Indiana</p> </div>         </div>     </li><!-- #comment-## -->     <li class="comment even thread-even depth-1" id="dsq-comment-5750">         <div id="dsq-comment-header-5750" class="dsq-comment-header">             <cite id="dsq-cite-5750">                 <span id="dsq-author-user-5750">Sgtadaniels</span>             </cite>         </div>         <div id="dsq-comment-body-5750" class="dsq-comment-body">             <div id="dsq-comment-message-5750" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>in my opinion all the things listed are money makers for each state..make it standard rather it is the CCW permit or plumbing, electric, or teaching&#8230;it is the we hold you to a higher standard which is causing the problem, ensure that it is at that standard for all states&#8230;.. and i think everyone should show that they can shoot a gun before they can receive a permit&#8230;&#8230;</p> </div>         </div>     </li><!-- #comment-## -->     <li class="comment odd alt thread-odd thread-alt depth-1" id="dsq-comment-5760">         <div id="dsq-comment-header-5760" class="dsq-comment-header">             <cite id="dsq-cite-5760">                 <span id="dsq-author-user-5760">Traveling Armed</span>             </cite>         </div>         <div id="dsq-comment-body-5760" class="dsq-comment-body">             <div id="dsq-comment-message-5760" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Wondering&#8230;.  I have business that takes me from the east coast, through Illinois, to mid-west points beyond and back again.  Just exactly what am I supposed to do with my firearm while in Illinois??</p> </div>         </div>     <ul class="children">     <li class="comment even depth-2" id="dsq-comment-5761">         <div id="dsq-comment-header-5761" class="dsq-comment-header">             <cite id="dsq-cite-5761">                 <span id="dsq-author-user-5761">Bob b</span>             </cite>         </div>         <div id="dsq-comment-body-5761" class="dsq-comment-body">             <div id="dsq-comment-message-5761" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Hide it well</p> </div>         </div>     <ul class="children">     <li class="comment odd alt depth-3" id="dsq-comment-6204">         <div id="dsq-comment-header-6204" class="dsq-comment-header">             <cite id="dsq-cite-6204">                 <span id="dsq-author-user-6204">StoutCortez</span>             </cite>         </div>         <div id="dsq-comment-body-6204" class="dsq-comment-body">             <div id="dsq-comment-message-6204" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Keep it unloaded and locked in a case in the trunk, and don&#8217;t spend the night in Illinois.</p> </div>         </div>     </li><!-- #comment-## --> </ul><!-- .children --> </li><!-- #comment-## --> </ul><!-- .children --> </li><!-- #comment-## -->     <li class="comment even thread-even depth-1" id="dsq-comment-5775">         <div id="dsq-comment-header-5775" class="dsq-comment-header">             <cite id="dsq-cite-5775">                 <span id="dsq-author-user-5775">Jbell</span>             </cite>         </div>         <div id="dsq-comment-body-5775" class="dsq-comment-body">             <div id="dsq-comment-message-5775" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>I have a Utah non resident CCFP.

It&#8217;s sad they are charging people to get an Utah permit with most other individual permits when most of these other stars with regards to I think 6 already recognize most other states CCW permits. Just knowing the laws I. Those states should be the important part of any CCW course. I can&#8217;t wait till my training is over and my classes start. I refuse to cram Utah down my students throats for an extra 60 dollars here 10 for prints and 10 for pictures. Too many instructors are raping the people who wish to carry and responsibly carry for defense purposes only. Not to show off.. Go look at state cross reference on NRA site or any mapping CCW site. It&#8217;s so cross accepted as of January 2012 is not necessary to get 7 permits. Just learn that new York jersey California and illinois are no Carry states.  Anyone in the Midwest email me I&#8217;m happy to teach you state laws and certify yo if you qualify. Yes all my student shoot unlike most states now especially Iowa. Email included in sub.

Depending on what county you live in it takes anywhere from 2 &#8211; 12 months to get your permit and that&#8217;s after you have already completed the following:<br /> 1. attended a safety class.<br /> 2. Had 3 non family member county residents fill out a form and had it notorized in order to vouch for your character.<br /> 3. Given a full set of finger prints,<br /> 4. Been cleared by the FBI<br /> 5. Been cleared by the State Mental Health Department<br /> 6. Paid a couple hundred dollars for the permit and safety class.<br /> 7. Purchased a firearm. (which most shops make you pay for in full even though your not permitted to even touch it or hold it in your hand prior to purchasing it! Of course you have to wait the 2 &#8211; 12 months for your permit to come in before you can pick it up from the store)<br /> 8. Had an interview with the Sherrifs department and provided a letter stating why you are applying for a pistol license.</p> <p>It took 4 months when I applied for mine a few years ago. I know a few people that waited over a year to get their permits. Think about that for a minute, It takes all this time just to purchase a pistol or revolver whether you intend to carry it or not! Just to purchase a gun to keep in your home in order to protect your family.

The British do that, and those poor people have lost their rights as have their cousins the Australians, and all because they were &#8220;reasonable&#8221;. There is NO &#8220;reasonable&#8221; when one&#8217;s own civil rights are at stake. And the right to keep and bear arms is a civil right, endowed by our Creator upon us. And I will never give in or give up on that point. And I was born and raised in NY City, which has the toughest gun laws, as well as the most USELESS LAWS in this Nation. And &#8220;reasonableness&#8221; and the arrogance of those who have been permitted to rule us there have ended up just about denying us our rights. I live now in Idaho.

You need a drivers licence, issued by your state after you receive proper training, etc. in order to operate a motor vehicle. No one complains about that because we all need a feeling of safety when on the road. We are adults. What I fail to understand  is : criminals are very unlikely to go through the process (speaking of NC) of training, fingerprints,  local and state law enforcement, FBI checks, your doctors ok, yet the law-abiding citizens go through this to receive a CC permit and are treated like children by the state. I personally am sick of hearing about women being abducted, raped, and murdered in broad daylight, in or out of their homes. Oft is said “well, she put up a good fight.”  She puts up a good fight when she drops the criminal like a bad habit. I would recommend what my wife has, a Ruger LCR 357 Magnum.

None of you have enough control over your emotions or mouths to deserve to carry a gun. You are dangerous. Carrying a gun is not something to take lightly and even more, not something you guys should be arguing about. You should all be in agreement and united for this purpose. Instead you argue like schoolboys in a schoolyard. It is people like you that cause law makers to worry about allowing just anyone to carry a gun. I believe deep psychological testing should be implemented before people should be allowed to carry a gun &#8230; and that&#8217;s only because I just saw the worse testosterone driven behavior I think I have ever seen online. Why is it you folks need to prove your manhood by arguing about something that is just batshit crazy. Wake up people.

I jumped up and swung the bedroom door open and walked hard into the barrel of 12 guage shotgun jamed in to my chest.<br /> I imediatly grabbed the barrel and forced it upward, I first tried to wrestle the gun off the intruder but then remembered what my dad had told me that he had learned in the war. that was that if I was ever in this kind of situation that I should go after the man not the weapon. The man will be defending the wepon with his life because if he knows that if you get it off him he is a dead man. So since he is defending it with his life, then it is an easy think to take;his life that is.<br /> I held the barrel away from me and my wife with one hand as he had a death grip on it with both his hands, with my free hand I was able to beat him until he lost enough conciousness to stand, I then remembered the second thing he told me, that was if the man goes down go down with him, otherwise he will still have the gun and you will now be at the wrong end of it, stay closer than the barrel length.<br /> So I did, and got the gun off him, I then put the gun in the hall behind me, and started fighting him and forcing him down the hallway to the stairs where I through him and he cleared all the steps and landed in a ball on the floor. unconcious I loaded him into the back of my truck and dropped him off at the police station. Then went home and back to bed.<br /> This all took time, a good having a good handgun would have made much shorter work of it and I could have got back to bed sooner:)</p> </div>         </div>     <ul class="children">     <li class="comment odd alt depth-2" id="dsq-comment-10305">         <div id="dsq-comment-header-10305" class="dsq-comment-header">             <cite id="dsq-cite-10305">                 <span id="dsq-author-user-10305">FreedomForever</span>             </cite>         </div>         <div id="dsq-comment-body-10305" class="dsq-comment-body">             <div id="dsq-comment-message-10305" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>You did better than me, I wouldve been cleaning red crap off the walls for a week.

I would also Like to mention that they put my on some medication after my back surgery that I had a Very BAD reaction to and it made me crazy and I dint know where I was or what I was doing and because of that I did threaten to take my life but the medication is very well documented as sometimes causing these types of side effects but this knowledge was not made Public as a high risk until a few years later. my Father is a doctor and he volunteers for multiple Fire,EMS and even Duncan, OK Police tactical squad as the medical director to be on seen in case something goes bad and someone get shot or hurt . I am no danger to anyone!! I understand all these crazy people that shoot up schools and Public Figures and cause problems to the public in general are Just that CRAZY and should never be anywhere near a gun!! I understand this is  why there is a need for these stronger Mental background checks. I just want to make sure I am not going to get denied for Life because  of Breaking my back and having crazy unfortunate and unforeseeable  problems afterwards. Is there anything I can do before I apply like, Getting My mental health medical records records without raising any red flags or talking to a lawyer even though I am no criminal by any means. I  just to make sure that I am in the clear and be sure 100%!! I am probably just worrying too much over nothing!! Please if you have any answers or suggestions Please let me know so I can take the right steps. I have been around guns my whole life an I am only now wanting to apply for CCL because I am afraid that if Obama gets re-elected that He may try to ban my rights or put super hard restrictions on even buying a Firearm. This is my second message I left another yesterday.Please help if you can Thanks So Much and God Bless!  </p> </div>         </div>     </li><!-- #comment-## -->     <li class="comment even thread-even depth-1" id="dsq-comment-8367">         <div id="dsq-comment-header-8367" class="dsq-comment-header">             <cite id="dsq-cite-8367">                 <span id="dsq-author-user-8367">Razortrix2002</span>             </cite>         </div>         <div id="dsq-comment-body-8367" class="dsq-comment-body">             <div id="dsq-comment-message-8367" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Is utah honor Nevada CCW?</p> </div>         </div>     </li><!-- #comment-## -->     <li class="comment odd alt thread-odd thread-alt depth-1" id="dsq-comment-8413">         <div id="dsq-comment-header-8413" class="dsq-comment-header">             <cite id="dsq-cite-8413"> http://profile.yahoo.com/EJSCTNE22CED2TTF6SVNZKD3CU                <span id="dsq-author-user-8413">Tina</span>             </cite>         </div>         <div id="dsq-comment-body-8413" class="dsq-comment-body">             <div id="dsq-comment-message-8413" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>If the weapon is NOT concealed either loaded or unloaded or it IS concealed and unloaded, is it ok to carry the weapon in any state?</p> </div>         </div>     </li><!-- #comment-## -->     <li class="comment even thread-even depth-1" id="dsq-comment-8454">         <div id="dsq-comment-header-8454" class="dsq-comment-header">             <cite id="dsq-cite-8454">                 <span id="dsq-author-user-8454">L49U</span>             </cite>         </div>         <div id="dsq-comment-body-8454" class="dsq-comment-body">             <div id="dsq-comment-message-8454" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>New York State does NOT grant non-residents concealed carry permits, the map is incorrect on that one.</p> </div>         </div>     </li><!-- #comment-## -->     <li class="comment odd alt thread-odd thread-alt depth-1" id="dsq-comment-8495">         <div id="dsq-comment-header-8495" class="dsq-comment-header">             <cite id="dsq-cite-8495">                 <span id="dsq-author-user-8495">Rwsmith250</span>             </cite>         </div>         <div id="dsq-comment-body-8495" class="dsq-comment-body">             <div id="dsq-comment-message-8495" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Gun laws and gun control only apply to law abiding citizens.  If a criminal wants to carry or buy/steal a gun he or she will. </p> </div>         </div>     </li><!-- #comment-## -->     <li class="comment even thread-even depth-1" id="dsq-comment-8496">         <div id="dsq-comment-header-8496" class="dsq-comment-header">             <cite id="dsq-cite-8496">                 <span id="dsq-author-user-8496">Rwsmith250</span>             </cite>         </div>         <div id="dsq-comment-body-8496" class="dsq-comment-body">             <div id="dsq-comment-message-8496" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Gun laws and gun control only apply to law abiding citizens.  If a criminal wants to carry or buy/steal a gun he or she will. </p> </div>         </div>     </li><!-- #comment-## -->     <li class="comment odd alt thread-odd thread-alt depth-1" id="dsq-comment-8500">         <div id="dsq-comment-header-8500" class="dsq-comment-header">             <cite id="dsq-cite-8500">                 <span id="dsq-author-user-8500">Reddesertsand</span>             </cite>         </div>         <div id="dsq-comment-body-8500" class="dsq-comment-body">             <div id="dsq-comment-message-8500" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Ok wheres Da map&#8230; been have issues seeing the map&#8230; I can get my specific state map but here is the national map where you can choose resident state and then what other non resident carry permits to see the overlap&#8230;</p> <p>thanks</p> </div>         </div>     </li><!-- #comment-## -->     <li class="comment even thread-even depth-1" id="dsq-comment-8502">         <div id="dsq-comment-header-8502" class="dsq-comment-header">             <cite id="dsq-cite-8502">                 <span id="dsq-author-user-8502">Drakes46</span>             </cite>         </div>         <div id="dsq-comment-body-8502" class="dsq-comment-body">             <div id="dsq-comment-message-8502" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>This all seems confusing I took the Utah concealed carry class in Indiana in April 2011 and was issued a permit to carry!

It was a hope by desperate people looking to take rights from all in this country. This was not just about gun rights but rather an encroachment on all. The court stated it means what it says and we do have a right to bear arms.Unfortunately some states feel they do not have to abide by the court if it does not go thier way. Other states try to hold onto control of what the public does. The issue of concealed weapons is really fruitless a nut job or a crook will always find a way to get a gun and slaughter the innocent and the unarmed.

Indeed, PA is now considering HB 2176, Constitutional Carry, which would provide for any person not otherwise prohibited, the right to carry concealed without any interference from Harrisburg.

What ever they did, I feel other states should follow. Its sounds simple enough. Im positive that making the existing laws work in favor of the law abiding citizens is SMARTER / faster / cheaper than creating MORE laws. My girlfriend is from Texas and has a CCP. I got my CCP in Iowa without classroom instruction because I am retired Army. THAT made sense to me. In my opinion, more criminals would think twice about robbing people if the possibility of them being armed were significantly increased, no matter what state you are in or from. What the anti-gun camp fails to understand is that a deterrent goes further in crime prevention than any law. I travel often and through many states. It would be nice to know that my 2nd Amendment right is honored everywhere I stop. I dont feel it should cost more to be honest in a different state.    </p> </div>         </div>     <ul class="children">     <li class="comment even depth-2" id="dsq-comment-8745">         <div id="dsq-comment-header-8745" class="dsq-comment-header">             <cite id="dsq-cite-8745">                 <span id="dsq-author-user-8745">Cpt Bob</span>             </cite>         </div>         <div id="dsq-comment-body-8745" class="dsq-comment-body">             <div id="dsq-comment-message-8745" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>I have friends who sometimes carry.

A state law does not supersede a constitutional or federal law.  Where are all the attornies that want to make a lot of money?  A civil right(s) violation by the government starts at 500M and only goes up from there!  Throw in governmental abuse of power and the sky is the limit.  Don&#8217;t forget to file civil suits against the people who aided in the denial of rights.  Take their house, bank account(s), car(s) jet ski, retirement account, kids colledge fund and don&#8217;t forget to attach their wages for the rest of their life to satisfy the judgement.  Taking everything a person or State owns will be a very big lesson for the people of the US to only elect government officials that abide by the constitution and who will not to overstep their boundries and power or suffer the consequence of a bankrupt state or local government.</p> </div>         </div>     <ul class="children">     <li class="comment odd alt depth-2" id="dsq-comment-8802">         <div id="dsq-comment-header-8802" class="dsq-comment-header">             <cite id="dsq-cite-8802">                 <span id="dsq-author-user-8802">myglock33</span>             </cite>         </div>         <div id="dsq-comment-body-8802" class="dsq-comment-body">             <div id="dsq-comment-message-8802" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Legal-eagle, Yup, I just noticed that someone had a lawsuit and won, I believe, in the state of Maryland.

This means that I, just as every other military member that passed boot camp has had more weapons training than the average American.  Why should I need a pass a civilian class to receive my CCP/CCW?  It is possible to get a fake ID and I am sure a fake DD214 as well.  Just as you can&#8217;t get fake finger prints, you can&#8217;t get a fake verified military record.  All the state agency would need to do is contact the appropriate records division of whichever military branch and verify that the person that is applying was enlisted and received a discharge that was not dishonorable or for mental health reasons.  IMO, the civilian class is a pocket lining racket instituted by those that we are supposed to trust.  Even if there isn&#8217;t a national database of permit holders, there should be a streamlined application process.</p> </div>         </div>     <ul class="children">     <li class="comment even depth-2" id="dsq-comment-8842">         <div id="dsq-comment-header-8842" class="dsq-comment-header">             <cite id="dsq-cite-8842">                 <span id="dsq-author-user-8842">WOP 2</span>             </cite>         </div>         <div id="dsq-comment-body-8842" class="dsq-comment-body">             <div id="dsq-comment-message-8842" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Dear Jarhead:<br /> Precisely!

Yet, I&#8217;m deemed unworthy to carry a firearm in quite a few states as result of unreasonable assumptions thrust upon the state where I reside and am permitted to carry concealed.  The states who have leaders who think firearms are too dangerous, won&#8217;t let me carry as I travel or work temporarily there.  I just saw a news article on a 15 year old gang banger in Kanas City arrested with a .357 mag wheel gun and his two adult accomplices were each carrying semi-autos&#8230;.none of these people had permits or proper training or justifiable reasons to have guns except for their drug trade activities.  Folks, the genie is out and won&#8217;t go back into the magic bottle.  I&#8217;m not real fond of arming the whole dang population, but I am supportive of arming the well trained, highly reasoning folks who can demonstrate the proficiency of responsibility that accompanies possessing firearms.  We are required to get driver licenses for a reason and that same logic applies equally to firearms.  I am fully qualified to drive in all 50 states by virtue of demonstrated proficiency yet denied constitutionally guaranteed rights in other states.  AG Holder and his gang of anti-freedom jackbooters need to go away and a reasonable dialogue needs to occur that contains not only common sense but respects the constitution.  The issues are complex and I understand the many sides of the problem.  Modern society should not engender the romanticized and inaccurate ideals of the old west.  However, we need to reach a reasonable, constitutional application of law that applies equally to all fifty states and the territorities.</p> </div>         </div>     </li><!-- #comment-## -->     <li class="comment even thread-even depth-1" id="dsq-comment-8928">         <div id="dsq-comment-header-8928" class="dsq-comment-header">             <cite id="dsq-cite-8928">                 <span id="dsq-author-user-8928">2LTGabs</span>             </cite>         </div>         <div id="dsq-comment-body-8928" class="dsq-comment-body">             <div id="dsq-comment-message-8928" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>I have an Oklahoma conceal and carry permit.

Mandatory training&#8211;never.</p> </div>         </div>     </li><!-- #comment-## --> </ul><!-- .children --> </li><!-- #comment-## -->     <li class="comment even thread-odd thread-alt depth-1" id="dsq-comment-9083">         <div id="dsq-comment-header-9083" class="dsq-comment-header">             <cite id="dsq-cite-9083">                 <span id="dsq-author-user-9083">Rick</span>             </cite>         </div>         <div id="dsq-comment-body-9083" class="dsq-comment-body">             <div id="dsq-comment-message-9083" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Illinois is the toughest completely denying the right to bear arms, yet take a look at their gun crime statistics.. lol the irony </p> </div>         </div>     </li><!-- #comment-## -->     <li class="comment odd alt thread-even depth-1" id="dsq-comment-9085">         <div id="dsq-comment-header-9085" class="dsq-comment-header">             <cite id="dsq-cite-9085">                 <span id="dsq-author-user-9085">Boston Boy</span>             </cite>         </div>         <div id="dsq-comment-body-9085" class="dsq-comment-body">             <div id="dsq-comment-message-9085" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>While I believe in national reciprocity, I have concerns if the federal government gets into issuing licenses, because what they give, they can take away!

A gun is considered to be loaded, in the case of a pistol, in practically 100% of the United States if a loaded magazine is inserted into the magazine well. Whether you have chambered a round is immaterial. This brings me to the more important question. Do you intend to carry a semi-automatic pistol without a live round in the chamber? If so, please attend a course of instruction specific to your firearm, get loads of practice, and carry with a round chambered. An empty chamber simply turns your semi-auto pistol into a brick. Some will say that it takes but a second to rack the slide. In a panic situation, you&#8217;ll point your blaster, pull the trigger, and when that sickening &#8220;click&#8221; instead of &#8220;boom&#8221; is heard, you&#8217;re already a dead man. Again, I&#8217;m not being critical, just offering some advice I&#8217;ve picked up in over 40 years of concealed and open carry.</p> </div>         </div>     <ul class="children">     <li class="comment even depth-3" id="dsq-comment-9285">         <div id="dsq-comment-header-9285" class="dsq-comment-header">             <cite id="dsq-cite-9285">                 <span id="dsq-author-user-9285">Slash</span>             </cite>         </div>         <div id="dsq-comment-body-9285" class="dsq-comment-body">             <div id="dsq-comment-message-9285" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>First I do not take offense at all, you answered my question, thank you.  Secondly, I have decent knowledge of weapons but have never conceal carried before.  I had just heard from a couple friends that you could not carry with one in the chamber in some states because it was illegal.  I just purchased an FN 5.7  a couple of months ago and I plan on practicing with it extensively as soon as my ammo I ordered arrives.  I also agree with you 100% that you should always have one in the chamber or your weapon is useless.  Once again thank you for taking the time to respond to my question.  I greatly appreciate it.

I just figured it might be easier to get a non-resident AZ card because I can throw a rock and hit arizona but it&#8217;d take me an hour and a half each way to drive to vegas to take the class do the paper work and pay out the nose to get a permit that AZ doesn&#8217;t even require it&#8217;s citizens to even have to carry lol.</p> </div>         </div>     </li><!-- #comment-## -->     <li class="comment odd alt thread-even depth-1" id="dsq-comment-9377">         <div id="dsq-comment-header-9377" class="dsq-comment-header">             <cite id="dsq-cite-9377">                 <span id="dsq-author-user-9377">Almoe</span>             </cite>         </div>         <div id="dsq-comment-body-9377" class="dsq-comment-body">             <div id="dsq-comment-message-9377" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Vermont is not a shall issue state &#8230; Vermont is a &#8220;No permit Required&#8221; state</p> </div>         </div>     </li><!-- #comment-## -->     <li class="comment even thread-odd thread-alt depth-1" id="dsq-comment-9433">         <div id="dsq-comment-header-9433" class="dsq-comment-header">             <cite id="dsq-cite-9433">                 <span id="dsq-author-user-9433">Jeff</span>             </cite>         </div>         <div id="dsq-comment-body-9433" class="dsq-comment-body">             <div id="dsq-comment-message-9433" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>This map needs to be updated.

The only reason I can think of is state politics and maybe revenue, permits are more than $100. here.<br /> The state has also started requiring proof of citizenship before renewing or acquiring first time driver license.

Some will state that it&#8217;s fair, some that it&#8217;s not.  I would tend to agree with AlanBuffloNY in that their are some states which issue CCW to some just for having a pulse.  C&#8217;mon folks, we know that many felons (unless their rights have been restored), should NOT be carrying a weapon, period.  That&#8217;s up to the judge.  And you invariably have to have a judge, or the local sheriff sign your permit.  So some of you want Rufus from the &#8216;hood, who knocked off a liquor store to carry?  I don&#8217;t think so.  But the fool who did a non-violent crime MAY get his rights restored if the judge accepts his basis for restoration.  Additionally, those who are mentally ill and can&#8217;t make good judgement calls shouldn&#8217;t have them either.  Frankly, some of the complainers may fit into either category, so sorry Charlie, you shouldn&#8217;t be carrying, and netiher should your inbred cousins.  We&#8217;re not making this the old West; and if we did, then lets bring back vigilante hanging so we can put your azz up in the nearest tree when you misuse your weapons.<br /> One thing I believe we can all agree upon:  make the standards for CCW permit the SAME all over this nation, and then allow those elible to carry in support of our 2nd Amendment.  But the criteria for carrying must be consistent, and troublemakers should not be allowed to carry.  Perhaps an IQ test would be in order, that&#8217;s clear up much of this nonsense.<br /> U.S. Army retired,<br /> 29 years, Special Forces</p> </div>         </div>     <ul class="children">     <li class="comment even depth-2" id="dsq-comment-9839">         <div id="dsq-comment-header-9839" class="dsq-comment-header">             <cite id="dsq-cite-9839"> http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100003300316146                <span id="dsq-author-user-9839">Benyamin Tover</span>             </cite>         </div>         <div id="dsq-comment-body-9839" class="dsq-comment-body">             <div id="dsq-comment-message-9839" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>And for those tough talkin&#8217; pizzants who think they&#8217;re tough, I served in 3 wars and actually have had to use rifle, pistol and machine gun in combat.

Mandatory training sucks, because in some states  (Utah, for example), you&#8217;re never required to fire a shot, just pass a written test. Including military police service, I&#8217;ve drawn my weapon 5 times since 1969, never having to have fired a shot. Thanks to God for that. What you will do if faced with a lethal force encounter is precisely what you have trained yourself to do. Hesitation will get you killed. I practice frequently from different positions, with pistol, rifle and shotgun, and can honestly say that while I think I&#8217;m prepared, I should, as a responsible firearms owner and concealed carry person, practice even more. The gun doesn&#8217;t make you tough. Mental, physical, and repetitive training make you tough. Sometimes a broken nose or a busted jaw administered by a crushing right cross is as effective as a .45.

One point I never, ever see called out is that there is documented proof that the (then) Soviet Union seriously considered/ weighed the benefits of an offensive (invasion) on American soil during the Cold War but the perception that every American was strapped to the tooth was enough of a deterrent.  The world is a hard place to live in.  And there will always been issues of violence; unnecessary, unfortunate and tragic violence.  Given this truth it is obvious at no time have we evolved to a place where the first law of nature (screw the Constitution) isn&#8217;t in play.  If you don&#8217;t want weapons, to carry them.  It&#8217;s really that simple.  But someone will always want to carry a big stick.  Written law is for the honest.  And the honest only.  Isn&#8217;t it conceivable in your (speaking to the deeply liberal) world that the very existence of the &#8220;unnecessary&#8221; weapons you hate so keeps some that we willingly trust just a bit more so in check?</p> </div>         </div>     </li><!-- #comment-## -->     <li class="comment odd alt thread-even depth-1" id="dsq-comment-9954">         <div id="dsq-comment-header-9954" class="dsq-comment-header">             <cite id="dsq-cite-9954"> http://pulse.yahoo.com/_FOQLPAPFFB3CHVXSYHCFJDJ5JA                <span id="dsq-author-user-9954">labillyboy</span>             </cite>         </div>         <div id="dsq-comment-body-9954" class="dsq-comment-body">             <div id="dsq-comment-message-9954" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>the People&#8217;s Republik of Kalifornia has decided not to allow citizens to carry firearms unless they are either celebrities, cops or bad guys. Los Angeles allows less than 1000 citizens who are not LEO to have CCW permits. Of course all our criminal gang members carry every day. Los Angeles is therefore one of the more dangerous places in the country, right up there with Chicago. Many places are off-limits, even the police stay out.</p> <p>The 2nd Amendment does provide me with the right to BEAR arms, but if I do it here it is at the risk of a long stay in a California jail, something I am not going to fool with as I have a family to protect and provide for. Even for those few with CCW&#8217;s, actually using a legally carried firearm would be risky, it is a arrest first, ask questions much later environment. The Police they hire here seem to like it this way. </p> <p>The 2A is for providing American Citizens as a &#8220;Militia&#8221; to stand up to police or gov&#8217;t forces to stop tyrannical behavior. Therefore, in my mind it does provide for possession of military equivalent arms and quantities of ammunition sufficient to overcome an out of control gov&#8217;t. Funny that it doesn&#8217;t really provide for hunting which is what the gunphobe, gun banning politicians always talk about nor does it really talk about defending just the inside of one&#8217;s home. As free men, we are allowed to own and carry weapons to dissuade the state from taking our liberties and rights. Just not in the PRK.</p> </div>         </div>     </li><!-- #comment-## -->     <li class="comment even thread-odd thread-alt depth-1" id="dsq-comment-9966">         <div id="dsq-comment-header-9966" class="dsq-comment-header">             <cite id="dsq-cite-9966">                 <span id="dsq-author-user-9966">Summit</span>             </cite>         </div>         <div id="dsq-comment-body-9966" class="dsq-comment-body">             <div id="dsq-comment-message-9966" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Bob,<br /> you miss a very important premis.  that is, power should be kept within the states.

Heres some quotes from Thomas Jefferson that you should read and live by&#8230;.<br /> &#8220;The strongest reason for the people to retain the right to keep and bear arms is, as a last resort, to protect themselves against tyranny in government.&#8221; Thomas Jefferson.<br /> &#8220;No free man shall ever be debarred the use of arms.&#8221; Thomas Jefferson.<br /> &#8220;Most bad government has grown out of too much government.&#8221; Thomas Jefferson.<br /> &#8220;The two enemies of the people are criminals and government, so let us tie the<br /> second down with the chains of the Constitution so the second will not become<br /> the legalized version of the first.&#8221; Thomas Jefferson.<br /> &#8220;When the people fear their government, there is tyranny; when the government<br /> fears the people, there is liberty.&#8221; Thomas Jefferson.<br /> &#8220;A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the<br /> right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.&#8221; Thomas Jefferson.<br /> And last but not least&#8230;.. &#8220;The beauty of the Second Amendment is that it will not be needed until they try<br /> to take it. Thomas Jefferson.<br /> Think about these quotes and you will discover why we need to take back our country from the tyrants of government. God Bless You All because we will need each other soon enough!  </p> </div>         </div>     </li><!-- #comment-## -->     <li class="comment even thread-odd thread-alt depth-1" id="dsq-comment-10316">         <div id="dsq-comment-header-10316" class="dsq-comment-header">             <cite id="dsq-cite-10316">                 <span id="dsq-author-user-10316">1911Kurt</span>             </cite>         </div>         <div id="dsq-comment-body-10316" class="dsq-comment-body">             <div id="dsq-comment-message-10316" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>I can&#8217;t believe that garbage, I havea ccwp in NY, UT,AND FL, and one of the only states I&#8217;m visiting this year is illinois bc of the stupid rights denied crap!

If that one state is denied then you can better believe they will try for more in the future. Thomas Jefferson and Ronald Reagan both knew this to be true. The 2nd amendment was put in place for a reason but the criminals in DC dont care about our forefathers and our beliefs in this country. In fact our rights gets chipped away a little at a time everyday. The criminals in government want to make up their own constitution.

For people that choose a life of crime, it&#8217;s like membership to any club&#8230; you have to earn your stripes to be taken seriously.  Prison is like doing a tour overseas and the gangs cross that border of prison walls like water slipping through fingers.  Their minds aren&#8217;t going to get changed by more legislation.  That only hurts the people that pay attention to the law to begin with.  People need to be able to defend themselves against those who would harm them and the police need to be able to effectively do their jobs without having to debate whether or not the newspaper is going to make a story out of an arrest that will ultimately ruin the officers&#8217; ability to engage in their profession and provide for their families.  The trust needs to be put back into the people and the pressure needs to be on preparing people to act like adults.

Just go see the movie: 2016 if you don&#8217;t believe me.</p> </div>         </div>     </li><!-- #comment-## -->     <li class="comment even thread-odd thread-alt depth-1" id="dsq-comment-10621">         <div id="dsq-comment-header-10621" class="dsq-comment-header">             <cite id="dsq-cite-10621">                 <span id="dsq-author-user-10621">tommie1107</span>             </cite>         </div>         <div id="dsq-comment-body-10621" class="dsq-comment-body">             <div id="dsq-comment-message-10621" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>You know whats so screwed up about this country, You got so many idiots who got permits and you got a lot of good people that cant get permits, All the bull-crap on money shoved out just to carry a firearm, Its crazy just open carry if your state permits it, Just put your gun in a case in your trunk and there is not a fricken thing the can do to mess with you, I&#8217;m not kidding no one i at least know 100 people who got permits and don&#8217;t even know how to load their pistol aint that the shit,  So wake up America this is all a money thing for REVENUE!!!!</p> </div>         </div>     </li><!-- #comment-## -->     <li class="comment odd alt thread-even depth-1" id="dsq-comment-10622">         <div id="dsq-comment-header-10622" class="dsq-comment-header">             <cite id="dsq-cite-10622">                 <span id="dsq-author-user-10622">tommie1107</span>             </cite>         </div>         <div id="dsq-comment-body-10622" class="dsq-comment-body">             <div id="dsq-comment-message-10622" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>You know what screwed up in Illinois is that if everyone was allowed to carry guns the criminals would steal them hell were do you think they get their guns,, that&#8217;s why you cant have a gun in Illinois , I respect all the cops their, I&#8217;m a trucker for 37 years i go thru Chicago on a daily basis and its a messed up City, Imagine what the cops go thru every night there, So don&#8217;t ever think that Illinois will ever give CCW&#8221;s never ever, If they did their crime rate would triple they are the worst in crime in the US, Last week they had 37 people killed just in one day, Thats fricken crazy</p> </div>         </div>     <ul class="children">     <li class="comment even depth-2" id="dsq-comment-10623">         <div id="dsq-comment-header-10623" class="dsq-comment-header">             <cite id="dsq-cite-10623">                 <span id="dsq-author-user-10623">John</span>             </cite>         </div>         <div id="dsq-comment-body-10623" class="dsq-comment-body">             <div id="dsq-comment-message-10623" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>I have to disagree with you Tommie.

Guns are just another tool.  Sometimes I carry one and sometimes I do not. Sometimes I carry my pocket knife and there are times and places I do not.  Sometimes I even carry a pen, but I almost always carry my must used tool &#8230; the cell phone.  Does it bother me that I have to do my part and not carry anything that could become a weapon on an airplane &#8230; no &#8230; I like when I have an excuse not to shave lol!   I would like to and want to follow our laws.  If one day the law of the land states that we can no longer carry a gun &#8230;. well?  Then would I find myself a made outlaw?  In NY a women can walk down main street topless.  Seems like a good idea for breast feeding mothers.  Do I want to see a man or a women walking into a corner store without shoes, or shirt &#8230; no I rather not.  Do I care if they want to feel the breeze on a beach or in a park &#8230; I don&#8217;t care.  When my father served in the US Army things were much loser and every soldier kept their weapon &#8230; Hence, some gun play got out of control and the weapons were locked up.  When I served in the US Army we kept control over weapons and ammo, yet a soldier afraid of going to Iraq after training manage to sneak a single round off the rifle range and shoot himself in the foot.  Growing up a deer hunter; at first, I was afraid to be next to my new fellow soldier that had no experience with a gun before joining the military &#8230; safety for them wasn&#8217;t natural it seemed.  In short, I for one would hate to see the right to carry a gun taken away.  That is not to say I think all people are fit to carry a gun! </p> </div>         </div>     </li><!-- #comment-## -->     <li class="comment odd alt thread-odd thread-alt depth-1" id="dsq-comment-10714">         <div id="dsq-comment-header-10714" class="dsq-comment-header">             <cite id="dsq-cite-10714">                 <span id="dsq-author-user-10714">Jeremy</span>             </cite>         </div>         <div id="dsq-comment-body-10714" class="dsq-comment-body">             <div id="dsq-comment-message-10714" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>The most upsetting thing about the argument on the 2-a, is the lack of undertsanding.

The 2nd Amendment is in the &#8220;United States&#8221; constitution, meaning it should apply to all states equally, similar to the &#8220;Miranda Ruling&#8221; and the 5th Amendment protection which applies equally to all states.  I could give more examples of how rules of the constitution apply equally to all states.  We need to attack this problem as a constitutional problem and not as individual state problems.  The way I read the constitution, concealed or open carry should be not be infringed by any state, I read no education or training requirement.  In Illinois, Bill of Rights,Article I, Sec. 22 reads: Right to Arms &#8211; Subject only to the police power, the right of the individual citizen to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed, Artical XII Militia, Sec. 1, membership; reads- The state militia consists of all able-bodied persons residing in the state except those exempted by law.  I don&#8217;t know why Illinois lawyers can&#8217;t when guns rights cases with these two rights in the Illinois constitution.

Among these 5 best for NR permits:  (1) Only UT, ND, and FL will allow carry in WA, (2) Only ND, FL, and TX will allow carry in NM, (3) Only UT does NOT allow carry in KS, (4) Only UT and TX allow carry in MN, (5) Only FL allows carry in FL!!!, (6)  Only AZ allows carry in NV, and (7) Only UT, ND, and AZ allow carry in WI.

And as such i believe in the right to defend myself, my family, and my way of life from all threats foreign and domestic.  yea i have a permit, but i don&#8217;t agree that i should have to have it, and in the state i live in i don&#8217;t have to have it but i got it for the reciprocity in 38 of the 48 lower states. and as an armed citizen i believe i have an obligation to carry every day and i do. i also believe that there will come a time when we will have to defend ourselves from ourselves, if that makes any sense.  think about this for a second, you and your family are walking down some street and your confronted by a man with a gun but you don&#8217;t believe that law abiding citizens should carry guns because the law will protect you, so you don&#8217;t have a gun or carry a gun, so the man grabs your child and demands your cash and such and you give it to him in hopes to save your child from harm. and what does this piece of slime do but shoot your child anyway because the child is of no use to him anymore and neither are you. so he continues to slaughter you and your family because he knows that you will not or can not defend yourself.now same situation except a group of law biding people pass by but they are concealed carry people and they see what is happening and do their duty draw the weapons they have and now the piece of slime must deal with being out gunned and because you also carry you are able to show that he will not get off so easy because you have drawn your weapon and stepped in front of your child to protect the child . i am just saying crimanals will have guns no matter what the law says, shouldnt you be able to protect your self? think about it in this situation where was the law when you needed them, they will show up after the child and possibly yourself and your family have been injured or worse killed, what help are they then.</p> </div>         </div>     </li><!-- #comment-## -->     <li class="comment even thread-odd thread-alt depth-1" id="dsq-comment-11720">         <div id="dsq-comment-header-11720" class="dsq-comment-header">             <cite id="dsq-cite-11720">                 <span id="dsq-author-user-11720">Johnny Alessi</span>             </cite>         </div>         <div id="dsq-comment-body-11720" class="dsq-comment-body">             <div id="dsq-comment-message-11720" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>I once watched a man get beat to death by another mans bare hands.

And there is nothing wrong with<br /> that.  The issue is just as much about respect as it is about rights.  Respect as in, respecting other people’s views. Everyone is entitled to their views and just because they don’t agree with your view doesn’t make them a bad person or a non-American. </p> <p>I am a bleeding-heart liberal, but I carry a Sig.  But I also respect those who are anti gun. </p> <p>I think anyone who supports gun ownership and calls those who are opposed to guns any kind of names or calls them unpatriotic is doing a great disservice to the cause.  It would be far better for the cause to inform and educate the non-believers if you will, than point a finger at them and call them names with more than a hint of disdain in your voice.  You will never convert someone if you start the conversation calling them names simply because they have a different option than yours.  It doesn’t make them any less American. </p> <p>Who knows, maybe one day you will come to the aid of someone and the fact that you were in a position to help or save them might be enough to convert them… and you didn’t even have to call them a name.   If you believe it’s our constitutional right to bears arms, than you should equally believe it’s our right not to.   It’s a matter of choice and nothing could be more American.</p> </div>         </div>     </li><!-- #comment-## -->     <li class="comment odd alt thread-even depth-1" id="dsq-comment-11740">         <div id="dsq-comment-header-11740" class="dsq-comment-header">             <cite id="dsq-cite-11740"> http://www.facebook.com/people/Agnon-Mema/100000001379385                <span id="dsq-author-user-11740">Agnon Mema</span>             </cite>         </div>         <div id="dsq-comment-body-11740" class="dsq-comment-body">             <div id="dsq-comment-message-11740" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>I live in Minnesota, and my permit is not honored in very few of the uber-pro-2nd Amendment open-carry states&#8230;..</p> </div>         </div>     </li><!-- #comment-## -->     <li class="comment even thread-odd thread-alt depth-1" id="dsq-comment-11750">         <div id="dsq-comment-header-11750" class="dsq-comment-header">             <cite id="dsq-cite-11750">                 <span id="dsq-author-user-11750">nopermitneeded</span>             </cite>         </div>         <div id="dsq-comment-body-11750" class="dsq-comment-body">             <div id="dsq-comment-message-11750" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>If law abiding citizens are not allowed to carry then only the criminals and the police who are so short staffed, underpaid, and overworked wil be carrying and we cannot defend ourselves.

Something needs to be done about that. I guess we will all have to ignore the laws, like everyone else just to protect ourselves. In other states you can walk into a gun shop/range with just an ID and be able to shoot. Here you have to have a FOID card.

I have children and a family that I dearly love. And when  I see all the home envasions, holdups, and random dumbazzs shootingg people these days, I choose to take the preventive stand. To all that are against HANDGUNS, let someone enterbyour home hurt your family and all you had was a phone and a hope 911 answers in time; you will get the picture. My family first and anyone trying to hurt them with fire will meet that fire multiplied. Victims of violence look at the gun not the person mostly, and many are against having a gun.

Its a select fire weapon capable of sustained fire with one squeeze of the trigger. It may be crew served, or man portable, but it must be select fire. That said, the NFA of 1934 put serious restrictions on civilian ownership of machine guns and submachine guns. While I don&#8217;t think its necessary to have an M-2 quad mount  at your disposal to repel home invaders, I&#8217;ll take an AR platform rifle, semi-automatic,  in 5.56 NATO anytime as an adequate firearm to defend the home, or the driveway, or the immediate field of fire outside my residence.<br /> I do agree that a hand cannon is a convenient home protection firearm, and I have one at my bedside. It will give me a chance to reach my AR or my combat shotgun.<br /> Thank you for your service to God and Country.

The basic permit allows you to carry most common places except anywhere alcohol is served or sold as a primary source of income, schools, federal bldgs, law enforcement centers, etc.  The Enhanced CCW, however, allows you to carry anywhere except a courtroom where a judge is on the bench, law enforcement centers, and federal bldgs.  The difference is that the enhanced CCW requires classroom training and range qualification.  Both require fingerprints and background checks.  This, to me, makes perfect sense and they have to be renewed every 5 years, including the class/range for the ECCW.  Logic is a funny thing&#8230;ain&#8217;t it?  It would make more sense to have better reciprocity or a uniform CCW process nationwide.</p> </div>         </div>     </li><!-- #comment-## -->     <li class="comment odd alt thread-odd thread-alt depth-1" id="dsq-comment-12704">         <div id="dsq-comment-header-12704" class="dsq-comment-header">             <cite id="dsq-cite-12704">                 <span id="dsq-author-user-12704">KG</span>             </cite>         </div>         <div id="dsq-comment-body-12704" class="dsq-comment-body">             <div id="dsq-comment-message-12704" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Problem is that some states will issue a CWP to someone that has never picked up a gun or seen one up close, much less had any meaningful training.

Do you want a Nanny State dictating what level of training and familiarity with your firearm you must have, or would you rather, as a responsible firearms owner, seek as much training as you can afford? It is incumbent upon any person who purchases any potentially dangerous item (chain saw, power mower, power saw) to insure that they safely and proficiently operate the item, and insure that children, and other adults, do not have unfettered access to the item.  I think any clear thinker can figure that out. State mandated training associated with the purchase of a gun can be capriciously changed at any time to make it more difficult or nearly impossible to buy, or to carry, a firearm for self defense. I mean, really, how much did you know about the destructive power of a chain saw the first time you bought it? Personal responsibility that accompanies each of our rights!

(see note at end of this post)  If any portion of the Bill of Rights can be ignored, then so can any other. Only until the 1st Amendment right to freedom of speech is censored, will we see emphasis on preserving the entirety of the Bill of Rights. </p> <p>Firearms freedom legislation and federal gun laws nullification<br /> Starting in 2012, in response to a threat of law made through executive orders by President Obama, more than a dozen states around the US began proposing legislation that would &#8220;&#8230;declare that any firearms made and retained in-state are beyond the authority of Congress under its constitutional power to regulate commerce among the states&#8221;. The legislation would require that the firearm be prominently marked as being &#8220;Made in {name of state}&#8221; and further prohibit federal regulation solely on the basis that &#8220;basic materials&#8221; and &#8220;generic and insignificant parts&#8221; of the firearm may have their origins from outside the state.</p> <p>Through 2010, resolutions have been introduced in the legislatures of 27 states that would nullify federal authority over such local firearms. The legislation passed in Montana and Tennessee in 2009 and in Alaska, Arizona, Idaho, South Dakota, Utah, and Wyoming the following year.[12] South Carolina has taken the issue one step further: in 2010 a bill was introduced which would effectively nullify all gun registration laws within the state.[13]</p> <p>Texas has prefiled[14] and West Virginia has filed[15] similar legislation for the current 2011 legislative session.</p> <p>Reciprocity<br /> Many jurisdictions have established arrangements where they recognize or honor permits or licenses issued by other jurisdictions with comparable standards, for instance in regard to marriage or driver&#8217;s licenses. This is known as Reciprocity and is based on U.S. Constitution &#8220;full faith and credit&#8221; provision.[39] Due to the nature of gun politics, reciprocity in regard to weapons carry permits or licenses has been controversial.</p> <p>[39]^ Article IV, Section 1, &#8220;Full faith and credit shall be given in each state to the public acts, records, and judicial proceedings of every other state.&#8221;</p> </div>         </div>     </li><!-- #comment-## --> </ul><!-- .children --> </li><!-- #comment-## -->     <li class="comment even thread-even depth-1" id="dsq-comment-13497">         <div id="dsq-comment-header-13497" class="dsq-comment-header">             <cite id="dsq-cite-13497"> http://www.facebook.com/tattoosbybill                <span id="dsq-author-user-13497">Bill Mckay</span>             </cite>         </div>         <div id="dsq-comment-body-13497" class="dsq-comment-body">             <div id="dsq-comment-message-13497" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Does anyone know if Pa and Va cancelled there resiprosity agreement</p> </div>         </div>     <ul class="children">     <li class="comment odd alt depth-2" id="dsq-comment-13508">         <div id="dsq-comment-header-13508" class="dsq-comment-header">             <cite id="dsq-cite-13508">                 <span id="dsq-author-user-13508">WOP 2</span>             </cite>         </div>         <div id="dsq-comment-body-13508" class="dsq-comment-body">             <div id="dsq-comment-message-13508" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Bill:<br /> No, but the new Pennsylvania Attorney General, Kathleen Kane, is a shill for Bloomberg and for the Philadelphia anti gunners.

First of all, Kathleen Kane, our new AG, has the right to enter into (and out of) reciprocity agreements. Why the legislature ever gave that to the AG&#8217;s office is beyond my comprehension. WE all knew she was anti-gun, but Soros, Bloomberg, and the Joyce Foundation poured a ton of money into her campaign, and of course the liberal dolts in Philly and Pittsburgh fell for it hook, line and sinker.<br /> Next step&#8211;for years, Lt. Lisa King, head of the License to Carry Firearms department in Philadelphia, along with Chief Ramsey and Deputy Commissioner Blackburn have routinely denied folks under Pennsylvania&#8217;s &#8220;character and reputation&#8221; clause. So, about 4000 folks spent the time, money (probably 150 bucks compared to 20 in PA), mandatory training (not required in PA) to obtain a Florida non-resident permit.<br /> Once the new administration got into power (the new AG) the Philadelphia coalition immediately clammored for her to kill the dreaded &#8220;Florida Loophole&#8221;. So, on her own, with no talking to the Legislature or the Governor, she came up with a rule that says&#8212;a Florida NON-RESIDENT permit is not recognized if the holder of the permit is a Pennsylvania resident, UNLESS said PA resident also has a PA License to Carry Firearms. So what do the 4000 do now? They have a short period of time to apply for a PA License to Carry Firearms.<br /> What you must know is that in the other 66 PA counties, the Sherrif issues the License. Philadelphia, our only city of the &#8220;First Class&#8221;, issues licenses through the Chief of Police&#8211;our anti gun ninny Ramsey. Truth be told, AG Kathleen Kane closed the Philadelphia loophole. The entire situation sucks, and PA House leadership is highly inflamed.<br /> Hope this qualifies as a &#8220;non-dumbass&#8221; remark <img src="http://www.usacarry.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> Its long, but its accurate.</p> </div>         </div>     </li><!-- #comment-## --> </ul><!-- .children --> </li><!-- #comment-## -->     <li class="comment odd alt thread-odd thread-alt depth-1" id="dsq-comment-13638">         <div id="dsq-comment-header-13638" class="dsq-comment-header">             <cite id="dsq-cite-13638">                 <span id="dsq-author-user-13638">Louis</span>             </cite>         </div>         <div id="dsq-comment-body-13638" class="dsq-comment-body">             <div id="dsq-comment-message-13638" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>They need to update the map Maryland will now reciprocate pa va de and wv ccw as of October of 2012  </p> </div>         </div>     <ul class="children">     <li class="comment even depth-2" id="dsq-comment-13656">         <div id="dsq-comment-header-13656" class="dsq-comment-header">             <cite id="dsq-cite-13656">                 <span id="dsq-author-user-13656">WOP 2</span>             </cite>         </div>         <div id="dsq-comment-body-13656" class="dsq-comment-body">             <div id="dsq-comment-message-13656" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Really???

Its black because black is usually associated with death. The right to keep and bear arms died in Illinois some time ago. You can mourn it, or support folks like Illinois Rifle. They are working hard to restore RTKBA. You are aware of McDonald v City of Chicago, right? All is not yet lost. By the way, when I&#8217;m in Chicago, I carry. I carry very discreetly, but I do carry. So do a lot of honest folks in Chicagoland.

Below are 3 cases leaning toward that the &#8220;Right to Keep and Bear Arms&#8221; does NOT extend outside the home.</p> <p>The Second U.S. Circuit Court upheld last November 27 New York State&#8217;s conceal carry law, which was very similar to Maryland&#8217;s in that it required a showing of &#8220;proper cause&#8221; to get a permit. The case was Kachalsky v. Westchester.</p> <p>The 10th U.S. Circuit Court ruled on February 22 in Peterson v. Martinez and shot down a challenge to the state conceal carry law, which limits permits to residents. In a sweeping ruling, the Court ruled that there is no Second Amendment right to carry a concealed firearm in public.</p> <p>The Fourth Circuit expressly avoided saying anything about the extent of the Second Amendment in the Wollard case, making the case unappealable to the U.S. Supreme Court. It simply ruled on March 21 that the state&#8217;s interest in protecting public safety and preventing crime justified the conceal carry permit law.</p> <p>So far the ONLY case were &#8220;Concealed Carry&#8221; was recognized outside the home is the Illinois case below:</p> <p>The Seventh U.S. Circuit ruled in Moore v. Madigan on December 11 that Illinois must enact a conceal carry permit law. It did so with a weak endorsement of the right to carry a loaded gun in public, saying that the Second Amendment &#8220;confers a right to bear arms for self-defense, which is as important outside the home as inside.&#8221;</p> <p>If the courts can&#8217;t agree on this, we ALL need to contact our congressional legislators to enact law that clarifies the right to keep and bear arms extends outside the home and in public places.</p> </div>         </div>     <ul class="children">     <li class="comment odd alt depth-2" id="dsq-comment-14078">         <div id="dsq-comment-header-14078" class="dsq-comment-header">             <cite id="dsq-cite-14078">                 <span id="dsq-author-user-14078">cawpin</span>             </cite>         </div>         <div id="dsq-comment-body-14078" class="dsq-comment-body">             <div id="dsq-comment-message-14078" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>You need to read a bit more.

The only people that are so eager to trample on your rights are those that either have no idea what it means to fight for liberty or have NEVER been in a situation that requires the use of deadly force. I will never understand how people think that the police will always be there to protect them when on average their response time is over twenty minutes. Its not their fault but they have limits and their limits could mean the difference between your families survival or their deaths. I&#8217;ll Dr. William Petit, of Connecticut, wishes he had the opportunity to own a weapon in 2007. He lost his family, two Beautiful Daughters and his Wife to two Unarmed Criminals looking to make an easy score.<br /> I have been in those life or death situations many times and I can tell you they Always come when you least expect them and its a Hellava feeling to hear someone tell you they are going to kill you and you have to make the decision to either fight or die. God has always been on my side and its heartbreaking to hear of the many times people lose their lives like the 20 kids and adults in Connecticut. But the world we once knew has changed and its no longer safe to take the meek and turn the other cheek. Politicians have no idea of the situation of the average American since Taxpayers have provided the means for them to have the very best in protection.

A lot of New York bashers got these northeast communists going!  Now that is funny.  I actually lived there and figured it out and left.  I didn&#8217;t lose anything there and if I did you can have it.  Pretty funny how New Yorkers always defend everything they know nothing about.  I too believe that you are brainwashed, if you weren&#8217;t then you would figure out the your extremely high taxes pay for the city.  Try moving out of that hell hole for a while, you might just wake up to reality.  Although New York is beautiful for 4 months, I wouldn&#8217;t live there just because my daughter does.  Oh, that&#8217;s right, my daughter does live in Upstate New York!  Since you voted Hillary into the Senate, maybe you idiots will try to replace the idiot Obama with her!  Yup, another thief amung thieves, she should be in prison.  My mom came from Canada and My dad from Syracuse, all of my relatives live there, most of them left, that tells you something!  And another thing, I don&#8217;t know what states just give you a permit, but I had to go through the exact same thing in TN as written in this blog for NY.  What really sucks about that is I am retired Army and still hold a security clearance that didn&#8217;t matter, still had to do the fingerprints and background check.

Simply lock your unloaded gun in a secure container not accessible to driver and passenger, and lock your ammo in a different container, also not easily accessible. Where you get your ass in a jam is if your final destination state has restrictions that are draconian, for example New Jersey or New York.

Drugs, deadbeat dads, crack mommies, and some realization that Obama isn&#8217;t going to save them has led to desperation, and the certain knowledge that there are no consequences for their actions. In other words, the law abiding have no way to lawfully shoot back, and by force of arms, shock the lawless back into reality.

It is an absolute nightmare to navigate across country and keep current on who accepts which license. I&#8217;m not sure it&#8217;s possible for a person to carry legally in all the lower 48 states being a resident in one state and traveling to all the others. So, does anyone know how a person can travel from the heartland (let&#8217;s say Kansas or Missouri) up to let&#8217;s say Connetticut or Maine without having to get 5 or 6 different permits? Is it even possible to obtain enough permits to be able to carry in all the lower 48 states? I currently have 3 different permits (1 resident and 2 non-resident) and still can&#8217;t traverse the continent with a loaded pistol. I&#8217;ve been subjected to fingerprinting, background checks, formal training, and have a squeeky clean background, yet I find myself an alien in my own country when it comes to self-defense and traveling by truck across the country. I&#8217;m totally against the federal government being involved, yet I find the state&#8217;s unwillingness to cooperate in reciprosity a complete nightmare. For instance, the fellow from New York who commented thinks that his state does it right and no other state&#8217;s permits should be honored in his state. ANYONE who&#8217;s issued a concealed carry permit in their state has gone through a background check, and has to be an upstanding citizen in his or her&#8217;s state to be issued the permit. Just because New York submits a 10-fingerprint card for an FBI background check doesn&#8217;t mean automatically their state has the best system. Both Kansas and Florida do the same thing &#8211; and guess what, New York doesn&#8217;t honor their permits. I find myself limiting travel through states which don&#8217;t honor the permits I hold. But back to my question: Can a person obtain enough permits so they can carry in all the states? Until that happens, we will remain divided on the topic.</p> </div>         </div>     </li><!-- #comment-## -->     <li class="comment odd alt thread-even depth-1" id="dsq-comment-16868">         <div id="dsq-comment-header-16868" class="dsq-comment-header">             <cite id="dsq-cite-16868">                 <span id="dsq-author-user-16868">JRS</span>             </cite>         </div>         <div id="dsq-comment-body-16868" class="dsq-comment-body">             <div id="dsq-comment-message-16868" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>So If have a permit to Conceal in the State of North Carolina driving to Wisconsin thru Illinois I have to separate and lock the firearm?

Reason is based on experience and logic and fear is neither, whether it is spiders, snakes, or firearms.  To attempt to talk or reason someone out of their fear is an uphill battle, at best, and waste of time at the worst.  I assume that it is the latter, like trying to teach a pig to sing, so I seldom try.  Also, some of these rubes just like to get a rise out of those who believe differently than they do.  Still, I am glad that we are not all thinking alike.  But one point I wish to make is the American Psychiatric Association (or whatever its name) agrees that at least 1% of U.S. population is certifiably, violently insane, yet less than 900,000 are in asylums.  Now, our last census was what, 250 mill?  What&#8217;s wrong with that picture? The Fed. gov. made a &#8220;least restricted environment&#8221; law, which turned much of the population or asylums out.  The basic criteria were based on availability of drugs which could control their violence and their ability to function among &#8220;normal&#8221; people.  So, does it take a Ph.D to realize that when the drugs aren&#8217;t taken, the person turns violent again?  Evidently, or our stupid Congress would not have passed the law.  As for spelling, it is not a sign of intelligence, however it does show an ability to memorize, apply basic, although often incorrect rules, and exceptions to those rules.  It tends to make a person, at least from my perspective, look more educated and insures that understanding of your thoughts will be more likely.  I was a teacher who graduated when requirements were more strenuous than they have been since  1970.  I graded essays by grammar usage, spelling, punctuation, continuity of thought, and other basics of writing.  Now, anything that is considered mechanics is not emphasized in most schools.  In reviewing the requirements for an 8th grade certificate in the 1890&#8217;s, I realized that I may have had some difficulty as a graduate in 1966, although some of those difficulties would be due to a change in terminology, geopolitical changes, etc.</p> </div>         </div>     <ul class="children">     <li class="comment even depth-2" id="dsq-comment-18916">         <div id="dsq-comment-header-18916" class="dsq-comment-header">             <cite id="dsq-cite-18916">                 <span id="dsq-author-user-18916">Telemachus_1</span>             </cite>         </div>         <div id="dsq-comment-body-18916" class="dsq-comment-body">             <div id="dsq-comment-message-18916" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>what the hell does any of this have to do with anything on this website, let alone this page?

I am an ex-police officer and field training officer with extensive firearms training, but I STILL had to go through the whole process of getting a firearms permit once I left the department (I was given no special treatment just because I was a police officer). The reason some states will not reciprocate is because they feel certain states do not meet what they feel to be an in-depth background check, or do not meet what they feel is their idea of quality firearms training. I can tell you, Indiana is just as in-depth as most states that do not reciprocate with us. I can&#8217;t use my permit in say &#8211; Ohio (who does not reciprocate with Indiana) – even though I’m an ex-police officer… I KNOW some people who live in Ohio that have permits – that – by my own experience, should NOT have an Ohio permit (or any state), but they do…  But MY experience and permit is NOT valid in Ohio.  My point is, there is no perfect way of determining who should or should not have a firearm permit, or what states should reciprocate with which other states.  My personal feelings are, if you have a clean background, and have attended at least a 10 hour firearm training course, certified through the state, you should be able to get a “National Firearm License”…  Meaning you should be able to carry your weapon to defend yourself and your family in ANY state in the United States!  If you have no criminal history, and have attended some firearm safety training, the right to self-preservation by whatever means, should not be dictated to us by ANY state or federal agency &#8211; Period!  Now before anyone gets all huffy and starts that ape-like bowing out of the chest about firearms training, let me just say, from MY experience as a police officer, MOST of the accidental gun related injuries or deaths I investigated over the years were due to inexperienced handlers, or an owner who left his/her weapon readily available to children or a home invader.  Most people may not need any form of training, but there are some who could use it&#8230;  How do you determine who has the experience necessary and who doesn&#8217;t?  Documented proof &#8211; that&#8217;s how.  If you attended any sort of safety course and have a certificate, you wouldn&#8217;t need to attend it again to get a permit.  OR, if you&#8217;re military, law enforcement or ex-law enforcement or military, you too should not have to attend a safety course again to get a permit&#8230;  I&#8217;ve NEVER seen a accidental firearm incident when the owner was properly trained.</p> </div>         </div>     <ul class="children">     <li class="comment even depth-2" id="dsq-comment-19311">         <div id="dsq-comment-header-19311" class="dsq-comment-header">             <cite id="dsq-cite-19311">                 <span id="dsq-author-user-19311">cawpin</span>             </cite>         </div>         <div id="dsq-comment-body-19311" class="dsq-comment-body">             <div id="dsq-comment-message-19311" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>I&#8217;m not even sure where to start with this…so here we go.</p> <p>&#8220;Indiana has a two tier process for issuing firearm permits&#8230; One locally and one on the state/federal level.&#8221;</p> <p>No, they don&#8217;t. First, there is no &#8220;firearm permit&#8221; in Indiana. There is a &#8220;License to Carry a Handgun&#8221; which, from the topic of this page, is what I assume you&#8217;re talking about. Second, there is no tier system regarding the state and federal government. The federal government isn&#8217;t involved in the issuing of the licenses other than their criminal databases probably being used to check for a disqualifying criminal history.</p> <p>&#8220;I am an ex-police officer and field training officer with extensive firearms training, but I STILL had to go through the whole process of getting a firearms permit once I left the department (I was given no special treatment just because I was a police officer).&#8221;</p> <p>This sounds like you think you SHOULD be given special treatment just because you were a police officer. You shouldn&#8217;t; we don&#8217;t live in a class-based society. Also, you can get a nationwide permit/license through an HR218 ID card if you are retired law enforcement, so your point is moot.</p> <p>&#8220;I can tell you, Indiana is just as in-depth as most states that do not reciprocate with us.&#8221;</p> <p>The only thing that would comparable is the background check since Indiana has no training requirement. That is the main sticking point with other states that do have a training requirement. Even then, Indiana&#8217;s background check for the License isn&#8217;t as in depth as it once was and, as such, doesn&#8217;t even meet the requirements for bypassing a NICS check when purchasing a firearm.</p> <p>&#8220;My personal feelings are, if you have a clean background, and have attended at least a 10 hour firearm training course, certified through the state, you should be able to get a “National Firearm License”… Meaning you should be able to carry your weapon to defend yourself and your family in ANY state in the United States!&#8221;</p> <p>Well, your personal feelings are ridiculous. The license/permit at the national level is the 2nd Amendment; that&#8217;s all that should be needed. You don&#8217;t have to get a permit or license to exercise any other rights and certainly not any of the others in the Bill Of Rights.</p> <p>&#8220;How do you determine who has the experience necessary and who doesn&#8217;t? Documented proof &#8211; that&#8217;s how.&#8221;</p> <p>Yes, documented proof that you are in the US legally. Again, that is all that should be needed.</p> <p>&#8220;OR, if you&#8217;re military, law enforcement or ex-law enforcement or military, you too should not have to attend a safety course again to get a permit&#8230; I&#8217;ve NEVER seen a accidental firearm incident when the owner was properly trained.&#8221;</p> <p>Again, you&#8217;re trying to create a separate class of people and trying to benefit yourself in the process. Police, and specifically in Indiana since I&#8217;m familiar with the state&#8217;s requirements, aren&#8217;t trained nearly to the level they should be and the vast majority are far below individual citizens that have chosen to get training. And, if you haven&#8217;t seen an accidental discharge from somebody that was &#8220;properly trained&#8221;, then you haven&#8217;t been around firearms for very long. It happens even to the best.</p> <p>Training is great for those who have the opportunity, myself included since I have, but it most certainly should not be a requirement to exercise a right. Even though I&#8217;ve had the training, I will fight against anyone who says somebody shouldn&#8217;t have the right, regardless of my personal feeling about that particular person.</p> </div>         </div>     </li><!-- #comment-## --> </ul><!-- .children --> </li><!-- #comment-## -->     <li class="comment odd alt thread-odd thread-alt depth-1" id="dsq-comment-19350">         <div id="dsq-comment-header-19350" class="dsq-comment-header">             <cite id="dsq-cite-19350">                 <span id="dsq-author-user-19350">CrazyHungarian</span>             </cite>         </div>         <div id="dsq-comment-body-19350" class="dsq-comment-body">             <div id="dsq-comment-message-19350" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>What is the best combination of non-resident CCW State licenses to have?

My point is how beautifully ironic that the same social/political cadres that routinely rail against the 2nd A as an inviolate individual right are going to get hoisted on their own pitard, because the same arguments they&#8217;re ramming down everyone&#8217;s throats by force should and will be used to ram real rights, like the 2nd A down everyone&#8217;s throats, too.  It&#8217;s not the right way to do it, but if it can start a trend back to recognition of truly equal, individual rights and responsibilities, I&#8217;m glad of it.</p> </div>         </div>     </li><!-- #comment-## --> </ul><!-- .children --> </li><!-- #comment-## --> </ul><!-- .children --> </li><!-- #comment-## -->     <li class="comment even depth-3" id="dsq-comment-20948">         <div id="dsq-comment-header-20948" class="dsq-comment-header">             <cite id="dsq-cite-20948">                 <span id="dsq-author-user-20948">V Tramell</span>             </cite>         </div>         <div id="dsq-comment-body-20948" class="dsq-comment-body">             <div id="dsq-comment-message-20948" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>A judge did rule it unconstitutional, but stayed the ruling knowing it would be appealed.

My home state requires 12 hours of training and I&#8217;ve seen lots of folks get Utah non-resident (5 hours) permit because the time required is shorter. My home state accepts Utah but I&#8217;ve asked three officers what they would do under these circumstances and 2 said they would call for instructions and one said he would take the individual &#8220;down to the station to get things figured out.&#8221;<br /> I am all for National reciprocity but, until that happens, shouldn&#8217;t you have a permit from your home state before getting other non-resident ones to carry on in your home state.

Western Maryland has talked about become its own state because of this crap.</p> </div>         </div>     </li><!-- #comment-## --> </ul><!-- .children --> </li><!-- #comment-## -->     <li class="comment even thread-odd thread-alt depth-1" id="dsq-comment-21235">         <div id="dsq-comment-header-21235" class="dsq-comment-header">             <cite id="dsq-cite-21235">                 <span id="dsq-author-user-21235">Cindy</span>             </cite>         </div>         <div id="dsq-comment-body-21235" class="dsq-comment-body">             <div id="dsq-comment-message-21235" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Can you get a handgun if you are not a citizen of USA but have a green card and not a criminal</p> </div>         </div>     <ul class="children">     <li class="comment odd alt depth-2" id="dsq-comment-21251">         <div id="dsq-comment-header-21251" class="dsq-comment-header">             <cite id="dsq-cite-21251">                 <span id="dsq-author-user-21251">Beebo</span>             </cite>         </div>         <div id="dsq-comment-body-21251" class="dsq-comment-body">             <div id="dsq-comment-message-21251" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>It depends on what state and county or municipality within which you live.

Pay a fee for the privilege to carry.  Register the gun &#8211; yearly.  Renew the carry permit every two years.  Background checks, competency, safe use and judgment testing too.   Your carry permit is for a specific gun.  Want to carry different types?  Permit for each type &#8211; tied to the S/N of the weapon you are carrying.  Caught with a gun that is not registered or tied to the correct carry permit, pay fine.  Sounds like the government right?  Well, two things are for sure:  1).  You will  NEVER  get rid of the guns that are out there.  2).  You will  NEVER  have all the sates work in conjunction unless it falls under a federal rule or guideline.   Basically you pay if you want to play.  Too poor to cover the nut?  How much did you pay for the gun?  If you can own gun(s) and buy ammo you can afford to pay for the right to carry CCW.   The lines for &amp; against guns are so divided it will never be decided unless proper legislation happens.  Oh, as for the money &#8211; put it into the background system used to check.  Beef it up.  With the number of guns (legal) out there, probably will be a surplus.  Maybe create additional or national violent crime victims funds, better training for handgun use and safety.   Heck, maybe also snatch a few bucks to put to the deficit?  But sitting back and pointing fingers and complaining will not solve anything.  Come up with a revenue generating idea and I&#8217;m sure politicians will salivate over &#8220;Mo Money, Mo Money, MO MONEY!!!&#8221;   But that&#8217;s just my opinion, i could be wrong&#8230;.</p> </div>         </div>     <ul class="children">     <li class="comment odd alt depth-2" id="dsq-comment-21444">         <div id="dsq-comment-header-21444" class="dsq-comment-header">             <cite id="dsq-cite-21444">                 <span id="dsq-author-user-21444">TUCO-the-ratt</span>             </cite>         </div>         <div id="dsq-comment-body-21444" class="dsq-comment-body">             <div id="dsq-comment-message-21444" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>You are wrong.<br /> Are you Dianne Feinstein lurking under a pseudonym?</p> <p>States will never agree exactly about concealed carry.

And since conservative refers to political party, not race I don&#8217;t see how you made that leap but ok. Curious though, who am I being racist against? What race am I oppressing or judging in my comment? Perhaps you should look that word up.<br /> I am going to assume you didn&#8217;t actually read the comments here other than this one. Excluding about 2 people the comments mostly contain anti (insert some unnecessary insult) libreals, Obama, blacks, mexicans and just for.fun anyone.who lives in a state with any kind of regulations on guns. There were a couple of folks who suggested it stay on topic (the topic being information about traveling across state lines with a gun) but as you will see if you bother to read them that did not happen.<br /> So as someone who has firearms, believes in the right to own them but does not think Obama wants to take them away from me or that only blacks and mexicans commit crimes with guns so none.of us should have to go through the process of permits or registration it is not a friendly place to be. Guns don&#8217;t belong to a political party. And if increased gun ownership by responsible people is the goal perhaps a spirit of welcome and inclusion would help. As someone who just arrived I assure you that is not what this is. If you don&#8217;t care, fine. But calling me a racist for.pointing out racist remarks is juvenile and transparent. And is an example of the the vary thing I was pointing out.</p> </div>         </div>     </li><!-- #comment-## --> </ul><!-- .children --> </li><!-- #comment-## --> </ul><!-- .children --> </li><!-- #comment-## -->     <li class="comment odd alt thread-odd thread-alt depth-1" id="dsq-comment-22732">         <div id="dsq-comment-header-22732" class="dsq-comment-header">             <cite id="dsq-cite-22732">                 <span id="dsq-author-user-22732">Mark</span>             </cite>         </div>         <div id="dsq-comment-body-22732" class="dsq-comment-body">             <div id="dsq-comment-message-22732" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>This map says UT honors NV.

It&#8217;s probably tougher to get one here than anywhere!  Why is it that Idaho recognizes everyone&#8217;s CCW (except Vermont) but everyone does not recognize Idaho&#8217;s?  Why is it that some states only recognize a permit issued to a person if that&#8217;s their home state but not one that&#8217;s issued to them by another state?

That mean that You have to prove you need a CCW. Like good ole mayor Bloomberg said.  You have to be important as I am to get a carry permit&#8230;.and your not. He has private body guards with all kinds of weapons that others can&#8217;t have and when we we the mayor he had the entire NYPD to protect him then. My big problem with this May Issue thing is just this. The federal courts have said many time now&#8230;..&#8221;It is your job to protect your self&#8230;not the job of the police.&#8221;  So the Governor of New York says you can&#8217;t protect yourself.

That&#8217;s what this is, not a states&#8217; rights issue.</p> </div>         </div>     <ul class="children">     <li class="comment even depth-3" id="dsq-comment-23958">         <div id="dsq-comment-header-23958" class="dsq-comment-header">             <cite id="dsq-cite-23958">                 <span id="dsq-author-user-23958">AR15DeadOn</span>             </cite>         </div>         <div id="dsq-comment-body-23958" class="dsq-comment-body">             <div id="dsq-comment-message-23958" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Cawpin  come on now!!!

My cousin from Illinois brought friends to my house in Louisiana and we went shooting outside my house.  I could not believe that they had never shot a firearm before.  In fact, they didn&#8217;t even know how to hold a firearm (rifle or pistol). After a short tutorial I let one of the guys shoot my crossbow at about 15 yds.  I have one of the big block targets for bows.  I have an RGB sight on the crossbow, sighted in at about 30 yds.  He shot about 4ft high, through my wooden fence, my metal shed and was stopped by my dog carrier.  These people are so constrained by laws that they don&#8217;t even know how to hold a weapon.  That&#8217;s a damn shame that their local governments want to keep them that way instead of having training programs to teach the how to handle firearms.  That&#8217;s why so many innocents are killed in Chicago gang wars.  They don&#8217;t know how to hit what they are shooting at.  If they want to kill each other, fine with me.  But learn how to shoot.  The blood of the innocent&#8217;s are on the hands of the authorities for being so restrictive.  Because the law abiding citizens don&#8217;t know how to defend themselves even if they are armed.  It&#8217;s shameful, but it&#8217;s more shameful that they keep voting to keep the boots of the well protected thugs (posing as lawmakers) firmly pressed against their necks.</p> </div>         </div>     </li><!-- #comment-## -->     <li class="comment odd alt thread-odd thread-alt depth-1" id="dsq-comment-23923">         <div id="dsq-comment-header-23923" class="dsq-comment-header">             <cite id="dsq-cite-23923">                 <span id="dsq-author-user-23923">The American</span>             </cite>         </div>         <div id="dsq-comment-body-23923" class="dsq-comment-body">             <div id="dsq-comment-message-23923" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>I am a Maryland resident, how would I obtain a non-resident ccw from WV?</p> </div>         </div>     </li><!-- #comment-## -->     <li class="comment even thread-even depth-1" id="dsq-comment-23977">         <div id="dsq-comment-header-23977" class="dsq-comment-header">             <cite id="dsq-cite-23977">                 <span id="dsq-author-user-23977">Trythis Last</span>             </cite>         </div>         <div id="dsq-comment-body-23977" class="dsq-comment-body">             <div id="dsq-comment-message-23977" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>I believe Ga only requires $$$ and a background check.
