We launched our first gameserver, it held all of 16 people to start out. We were one of the only cracked servers online at the time. No BigBrotherBot, no Anti-GUID spoofers. Nothing. Weeks after we launched we know we needed a website. The first of which was lauched, on <a href="http://dbp-clan.webs.com/apps/forums/">Webs.com</a> >.< We quickly outgrew that poor excuse for a website. So we did the next logical thing <a href="http://dbpclan.userboard.net/forum">FREE FORUMS!!</a> Yea, it's just as bad as it sounds.</p></blockquote>             <a href="#startingout">Back to the Top!</a>             <a name="2009"></a><h2>2009-ish</h2>             <blockquote><p class="lead">2009 went by rather smoothly, we had added another Mixed server to our list and were growing at a pretty decent rate. DbPClan.net was born. We got our own domain name and our own web hosting account! Smitty (from NoBS Clan) fell on hard times, he needed money for his hardcore meth addiction. 5 of the most popular gameservers were up for the taking, and we did just that. July 2009, <a href="http://www.nobsclan.com/index.php?topic=7941.105">NoBS joined powers with DbP (kinda) </a>Days after the sale was completed, Punkbuster killed us. All of our servers were banned by PB. This was a dark time, we'd lost everything and had no more money to restart. Timmay graciously donated a server and kept us up and running. This eventually fell through and were were back at square one again. I (Patrick) took a long break and was pretty done with gaming. Ryan stepped up and led us into 2010-ish.</p></blockquote>             <a href="#startingout">Back to the Top!</a>             <a name="2010"></a><h2>2010-ish</h2>             <blockquote><p class="lead">New server provided by JestServers was up and running! I was able to configure B3 (BigBrotherBot) and DbPClan was thrusted into the 21st century. This was a year that led to many accomplishments. We lauched the #1 and #2 Call of Duty 4 server (according to GameTracker). We started modding! ProMod, Zombies, you name it we tried it. ProMod was taking off. Very low latency, and a great community to restart these servers. Battlefield Bad Comapny 2 was release on PC! We joined the ranks of the server hosting elite by claiming another #1 slot on Gametracker for BC2!</p></blockquote>             <a href="#startingout">Back to the Top!</a>             <a name="2011"></a><h2>2011-ish</h2>             <blockquote><p class="lead">This was also a very turbulant year, the DDoS attacks from our rivals became too strong and we were forced out of our cozy Game Server Provider. We eventually moved off to ColoCrossing! We had a giant 100mbit pipe to eat all the mean packets, or so we thought. <a href="http://ar51.eu/">AR51 Clan </a>was our biggest "rival" I use the word rival very loosely. <a href="http://ar51.eu/user/1-kevinos/">Kevinos</a> is a child, a child with far too much money, and too much time on his hands. He lauched hundreds if not thousands of DDoS attacks on us. Ranging from a small 50mbit SYN flood, to a very large multi-gigabit attack. The final attack caused us to relocate yet again. In late 2011, we moved off of our nice box in ColoCrossing to a new dedicated server at Incero (Dallas, TX). We custom built two servers, one to act as a firewall and the other to host our games. This worked out great! 2011 also brought some awesome advancements. Connor donated his time and energy to create our Anti-GUID spoofing application. This was again stolen by Kevinos and rebranded to be his own. FYI we had a call back in that application, thanks for your Rcon passwords!</p></blockquote>             <a href="#startingout">Back to the Top!</a>             <a name="newname"></a><h2>DigitalBattleField?</h2>             <blockquote><p class="lead">DbPClan was started as "DonkeyBonrProductions" we were 12 at the time and it was HILARIOUS! Fast forward a while, it was no longer funny. We didn't want to be a clan anymore. We wanted to be a community, so we re-branded. New shiny logo, new shiny website design and a new forum sofware. vBulletin was a nightmare to maintain. IPB was so much nicer.</p></blockquote>             <a href="#startingout">Back to the Top!</a>             <a name="theend"></a><h2>2012 -> The End</h2>             <blockquote><p class="lead">CoD4, BF3, Minecraft, we were hosting them all. We were riding high, riding so high it was bound to crash. Late 2012, I had lost my job, and Ryan headed off to do something. No money, no time, and certainly no willpower to keep hosting servers for a bunch of whiny 12 year olds. I left the site up for 2 more years, hoping that one of us would have the enthusiasm to start back up. Sadly we did not. After coming to the decision that we were done I wanted to provide a tombstone for something that was DigitalBattlefield.
