Does sleep debt make you fat or does extra  weight make it hard to sleep?  Both.  Like most things involving sleep, the  interactions are complex and the causal relationship runs both ways.</p>           <p>            Higher BMI is correlated with shorter sleep time.  It is also correlated with later sleep than  normal (going to bed late and getting up late.)   Not enough sleep results in a tendency to gain weight.  This isn’t true for everybody (some people  actually lose weight when they don’t sleep enough), but over the population as  a whole it has repeatedly been shown that less sleep results in added fat.</p>           <p>            Sleep debt increases the appetite, and particularly increases the desire for  high-calorie, carbohydrate-rich foods.   Functional MRI scans show higher activation in an area of the brain  involved with appetite.  This is one  obvious reason for weight gain, although the deeper picture is more  complex.  In some situations, <a href="http://www.aasmnet.org/Articles.aspx?id=1289" target="_blank">researchers  have found</a> sleep restricted  subjects did not have an increased appetite, but they still gained weight.</p>           <p>            Although even one night of short sleep can result in a desire to eat more,  the second night of a <a href="http://www.uchospitals.edu/news/2004/20041206-sleep.html" target="_blank">very short sleep left participants</a> in a controlled study  reaching for cookies and cake and eschewing fruit and vegetables.</p>           <p>            Why the connection between sleep duration and excessive weight?              When you are tired from insufficient sleep, you might fidget less and burn  fewer calories, but a more likely explanation is the effect of sleep  deprivation on hormones.</p>           <h2>Hormones, sleep, and weight</h2>           <p>Adipocytes (your “fat cells”) release <strong>leptin</strong> to the  bloodstream to signal sufficient fat stores; leptin therefore acts as a natural  appetite supressor. The stomach releases <strong>ghrelin</strong> when it is  empty signal hunger. (That’s oversimplified; ghrelin is suspected to be  associated with the body’s long-term weight regulation – levels are higher in  obese people than lean people.)</p>           <p>            Sleep deprivation lowers the levels of leptin and raises levels of grehlin.  It’s a double whammy hormone hit that makes you want to eat more. The brain is  getting signals that the body is starving, so you crave food.</p>           <p> Lack of sleep affects leptin and ghrelin; short sleep time (4 hours per  night or less) results lower leptin levels and higher ghrelin levels in the  blood plasma. With sleep loss, low leptin and high ghrelin can give powerful  dual signals that the body has an energy deficit, thus increasing food intake.  (<a href="http://medicine.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-document&doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.0010062" target="_blank">Ref</a>)</p>           <p>            Leptin levels in the body follow a circadian rhythm although unlike the  sleep circadian cycle the leptin one is not correlated with daylight and  night.  The cycle is more tied to  habitual meal patterns.  Exercise also  makes leptin levels fall.</p>           <p>            Other hormones are intimately tied up with both sleep and weight. A  reciprocal interaction of the growth hormone releasing hormone (GHRH) and  corticotropin-releasing hormone play a role in sleep patterns. Ghrelin, galanin  and neuropeptide Y have been shown to promote sleep</p>           <p>            Additionally, the <a href="http://www.sleepdex.org/orexins.htm">orexin</a> (hypocretin) system in the hypothalamus plays a part in the interaction between  sleep and appetite. Orexin levels influence leptin release, which in turn  regulates appetite and weight and tells the brain how much energy the body has.  Scientists do not fully understand all these interactions. There are many  competing systems and cycles in the body. A better understanding of these  system might result in new avenues for addressing the sleep disorder epidemic  and the obesity epidemic. Researchers <a href="http://www.utsouthwestern.edu/utsw/cda/dept353744/files/515068.html" target="_blank">recently found </a>that oxerin appears to increase the body's  sensitivity to leptin, leading to the promise that ways to boost oxerin levels  may eventually become a therapy for obesity.</p>           <p>It is hypothesized that there are evolutionary reasons for this connection.  Mother Nature may have set us up to store fat in summer in anticipation of  scarcer food in the winter. Summertime has shorter nights and longer days –  people tend to sleep less during the summer – so the body interprets these  circadian signals as a time to increase fat deposits.</p>           <p>            Scientists have now <strong>definitely established the link</strong>. There  are genes controlled by the circadian clock that regulates sleeping/waking and  some of the same genes also contribute to fat deposits.</p>           <p>            This result comes from animal tests. When researchers turned off the clock  gene in mice (through genetic engineering),<a href="http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?articleID=8D85F9AD-E7F2-99DF-33FEE8FDB56E2881&chanID=sa003" target="_blank"> the mice did not gain weight on a high calorie diet compared  with a control group</a>. The glucose and lipid metabolic pathways were  disrupted. The genetically modified mice did not store fat in the same  quantities.</p>           <p>            A <a href="http://www.journalsleep.org/ViewAbstract.aspx?pid=28021">Cleveland  Family Study</a> looked into this issue found that adipokines and sleep  duration. Leptin and visfatin are hormones released by adipose tissue (they are  called adipokines) and they are higher in people with high insulin resistance,  meaning they have or are at risk for diabetes. When subjects were deprived of  sleep, the blood levels of these hormones rose. Each hour of short sleep caused  a 6% increase in leptin and a 14% increase in visfatin. Another adipokine, <a href="http://diabetes.diabetesjournals.org/content/55/10/2805" target="_blank">retinol-binding  protein 4</a>, which is also strongly suspected to contribute to insulin  resistance, did not vary with sleep duration. </p>           <p>There is some indication that the body reacts differently to sleep  restriction during times of stress versus other times.  Sleep loss due to stress may lead to more  food consumption the next day than sleep loss due to other causes.  The calorie-rich food <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20545838" target="_blank">people crave in such  periods</a> is often referred to as &quot;comfort food&quot;.</p>           <p>&nbsp;</p>           <p><a href="http://www.sleepdex.org/fat.htm">More on sleep restriction and weight gain. </a></p>           <p><a href="http://www.sleepdex.org/fasting.htm">Effect of fasting on sleep. </a></p>                  <p><a href="http://www.sleepdex.org/nes.htm">Nocturnal eating syndrome </a></p>           <h4>Related stories:</h4>           <p><a href="http://www.utsouthwestern.edu/utsw/cda/dept353744/files/515068.html">Orexin blocks weight gain              in mice</a></p>           <p>Scientific American: <a href="http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/2010/10/04/sleep-might-help-dieters-shed-more-fat/"  title="Permanent Link to Sleep might help dieters shed more fat">Sleep might help dieters shed more fat</a></p>           <!-- InstanceEndEditable --> <p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; </p>           </td>         <td id="rightcol"> <h3>&nbsp;</h3>           <h2>Sleep Disorders </h2>           <h3>&nbsp;</h3>           <p><a href="http://www.sleepdex.org/parasomnias.htm"><font size="+1">Parsomnias</font></a></p>           <p>&nbsp;</p>           <p><a href="http://www.sleepdex.org/dyssomnias.htm"><font size="+1">Dyssomnias</font></a></p>           <h3>&nbsp;</h3>           <h3><a href="http://www.sleepdex.org/circadianrsd.htm">Circadian Rhythm Disorders</a></h3>           <h3>&nbsp;</h3>           <h3>Specific Groups</h3>           <p>&nbsp;</p>           <p><a href="http://www.sleepdex.org/women.htm"><strong>Women and Sleep Disorders</strong></a></p>           <p> <a href="http://www.sleepdex.org/seniors.htm"><strong>Insomnia in old people</strong></a></p>           <p><a href="http://www.sleepdex.org/alcohol1.htm"><strong>Sleep and alcohol</strong></a></p>           <p><a href="http://www.sleepdex.org/realistic.htm"><strong>Realistic Sleep </strong></a></p>           <p>&nbsp;</p>           <p><a href="http://www.sleepdex.org/prevalence.htm">Prevalence of Insomnia </a></p>           <p><a href="http://www.sleepdex.org/hypnogogia.htm">Hypnogogia </a></p>           <p><a href="http://www.sleepdex.org/mattresshype.htm">Debunking mattress hype</a></p>           <p><a href="http://www.sleepdex.org/orexinantagonists.htm">Orexin Antagonists in the Spotlight</a> </p>           <p>&nbsp;</p>           <p>&nbsp;</p>           <p> &quot;O Sleep, rest of all things, mildest of the gods, balm of              the soul...&quot; </p>           <p> <em>(Iris to Hypnos.
