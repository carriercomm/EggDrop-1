seriously had to improve translating from Hungarian!), thanks for all good words and constructive criticism. :-)</p> <p>Lets proceed then, with some numbers:</p> <ul> <li>21 commits since alpha 1 (plus 3 "fake", created by github merges),</li> <li>5 pull requests (3 merged),</li> <li>37 issues created (relax, it includes wishes and tasks too),</li> <li>20 issues still open (including 3 bugs),</li> <li>2 179 downloads of experimental packages according to sf.net statistics,</li> <li>102 stargazers, 37 followers and 14 forks on github,</li> <li>over 13 600 unique visits on homepage (over 20% coming <a href="http://phoronix.com"><strong>phoronix.com</strong></a>).</li> </ul> <p>In terms of coding this week was "weak", I've barely had time to code myself (but still I've managed to enforce "at least one commit per day" policy ;-)), since project management eats most of the time.</p> <p>Hopefully it will improve soon. Some nice features are currently being worked on, those who follow IRC know what exactly is being cooked right now. :-)</p> <p>Those who would like to <strong>get involved</strong> are welcome to check out <a href="https://github.com/Emdek/otter/issues?state=open">issues page</a>, items marked as "junior jobs" can be taken (but please ask first on IRC, they may not be always properly marked as taken) and there are also "discussion" tickets, where feedback is especially welcomed.</p> <p>In case of programming task please take a look at <a href="https://github.com/Emdek/otter/blob/master/HACKING">HACKING</a> file first, it contains some rules that will be mercilessly enforced (well, in worst case I can do code reformatting myself, I know, some of these rules seems to be "weird" ;-)).</p> <p>Last but not least, I would like to clear some misconception about source of inspiration, it is not <em>Maxthon</em> (which itself is inspired by <em>Opera</em>, but remains closed source), I've only meant that I've used it a bit in 2004, when it was still called <em>MyIE2</em> (I couldn't stand simplistic UI of vanilla IE), before going for <em>Opera</em>.</p> <h3>Alpha 1 release (01-01-2014)</h3> <p>So time has come and there we have first (very) experimental binary packages which can be obtained from <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/otter-browser/files/">sf.net downloads page</a>, source packages can be fetched from <a href="https://github.com/Emdek/otter/releases">github</a>.</p> <p>Keep in mind that this is very early version and there are lots of things still to be done (especially more UI customization features), all things listed in <a href="https://github.com/Emdek/otter/blob/master/TODO">TODO</a> are not yet available but will be added one after another, also including minor or obvious stuff not listed there.</p> <p>Please not to judge project until first beta (hopefully in early March), this is first public release done after only 400 commits (two months of work).</p> <p>This page will see more improvements later, for now it's best to stick with <a href="https://github.com/Emdek/otter/commits/master.atom">Atom feed channel on github</a>, for now it makes more sense to focus on browser itself.</p> <p>Thanks for early feedback (including some criticism, yeah, I've read most of these comments scattered around internet :-P) and support. :-)</p> <h2>FAQ</h2> <p>To avoid (un)intentional FUD please refer to these answers for the most common questions.</p> <p>If something is missing you can always ask me on the project's IRC channel (it is the preferred way of communication).</p> <dl> <dt>Why yet another <em>QtWebKit</em> browser?</dt> <dd> <p>First of all, <em>Otter</em> is not intended to be such a thing, from beginning it is designed to support multiple backends.</p> <p>Since Qt5 currently ships only one web engine (QtWebEngine is still in the works, planned for inclusion not earlier that in Qt 5.3) Otter has no other option for now (creating bindings is not a trivial task...), but as soon it will become possible it will gain support for Blink (through QtWebEngine) and maybe others (someone tried once to build Qt version of Firefox, so there should be Gecko binding somewhere...). ;-)</p> <p>As long time Opera user (since 2004, spending only few initial months using Maxthon etc.) I have some specific needs that cannot be fulfilled by any of existing web browsers.</p> <p>There will be no entry "Why Qt?", why? Because Qt (while not perfect) is simply the best choice. ;-)</p> </dd> <dt>Why not to join other projects focusing on QtWebKit?</dt> <dd> <p>There are multiple reasons why to not do that, I will list three of them.</p> <p>First of all, Otter has different goals, its primary objective is to become haven for power users that cannot stand what happened to Opera after ditching Presto engine.</p> <p>Secondly, most of existing projects come from Qt4 era, while Qt5 gave many new features and simplified many tasks directly in QtWebKit or indirectly (mostly QtNetwork module, like new API for QNetworkCookieJar). Existing projects still use workarounds for missing features, even Qt examples were only barely touched to work with Qt5...</p> <p>Last but not least, it is a bit of NIH, but it is simply too easy to create such project with Qt, design it from scratch than try to fit in in existing architecture.</p> </dd> <dt>Are you going to simply clone UI and all features of Opera?</dt> <dd> <p>Nope, not all of it is even possible or feasible (like Unity, widgets etc.), some of these concepts started to show their age or could be simply done better (for example more flexible while being also simpler to implement and comprehend by end user).</p> <p>Also you have to keep in mind that classic Opera regressed substantially in recent versions, simplifying (in some places far too much) and removing features (even before dropping whole "Opera" after 12.x) by trying to keep up with simplicity of Chrome and IE.</p> <p>Additionally Otter will be not a monolithic browser, it is designed to be very modular, going so far that you could replace whole bookmarks manager or history viewer (not yet currently, but with only one step missing, proper plugins, abstraction layer is in place already).</p> <p>Had I mentioned that I want to have built-in mail client? Do not be afraid, it will be optional module (possibly able to live as standalone application), it will not "bloat" entire browser. ;-)</p> <p>Native look and feel is also important, although skinning abilities are also planned (including support fo Opera skins and personas).</p> </dd> <dt>Why this name, <em>Otter</em>?</dt> <dd> <p>I don't like "invented" names (don't look deeper into history of repository, you will find such name there, thankfully I've changed it quickly ;-)).</p> <p>I've chosen <em>Otter</em> because it also start with "o", furthermore it has the same amount of letters as <em>Opera</em>.</p> <p>Why there is <em>Browser</em> in name? There was already such package, some mathematics related software (such ones probably should use invented names, or at least prefix or suffix them).</p> <p>Coincidentally full name is pronounced in similar way to <em>Other Browser</em>, and well, indeed <em>Otter</em> intends to be different from current mainstream trend of UI oversimplification (and in fact it started with <em>IE</em> years ago, I believe that <em>Chrome</em> was trageted to takeover users of that browser, which had biggest market share back then).</p> <p>Also it allows "fun" jokes about for example <em>Firefox</em> (the last "mainstream" browser that didn't lost its identity, at least not yet), fire and water. ;-)</p> </dd> <dt>Maybe you should try with <em>Kickstarter</em> campaign?</dt> <dd> <p>I was thinking about such possibility before launching alpha, also some people suggested it, for example on <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/operabrowser/comments/1u3tnw/someones_cloning_12x_opera/cef1lgy">Reddit</a>.</p> <p>While it would be nice to get some cash for development (and invest into VPS for automated buildbot or SSD to increase compilation speed a bit) but success there could lead to failure of entire project, since it could create too much pressure for me.</p> <p>So while it's tempting it should be avoided, at least for now (some legal entity would be needed first too).</p> </dd> </dl> <h4>&#169; 2013 - 2014 <a href="http://emdek.pl">Emdek</a>, <a href="http://cba.pl">Hosted by CBA.pl</a></h4> </body> </html>
