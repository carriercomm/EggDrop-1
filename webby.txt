The illustrations are based on observed data from the U.S. Geological   Survey's (USGS) National Streamflow Information Program (<a href="http://water.usgs.gov/nsip">http://water.usgs.gov/nsip</a>). The period 1930-2013   was used because prior to 1930, the number of streamgages was too small to   provide representative data for computing statistics for most regions of the   country.<br />   <br /> In the summary, reference is made to the term &quot;runoff,&quot; which is   the depth to which a river basin, State, or other geographic area would be   covered with water if all the streamflow within the area during a specified time period was uniformly distributed upon it. Runoff quantifies the magnitude of water   flowing through the Nation's rivers and streams in measurement units that can   be compared from one area to another.<br />   <br /> Each of the maps and graphs below can be expanded to a larger view by   clicking on the image.
