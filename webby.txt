The intent of this site is to provide a   complete set of free online (and downloadable) notes and/or tutorials for classes that I teach at <a href="http://www.lamar.edu">Lamar University</a>.  I've tried to write the notes/tutorials in such a way that they should be accessible to anyone wanting to learn the subject regardless of whether you are in my classes or not.  In other words, they do not assume you've got any prior knowledge other than the standard set of prerequiste material needed for that class.  In other words, it is assumed that you know Algebra and Trig prior to reading the Calculus I notes, know Calculus I prior to reading the Calculus II notes, <em>etc</em>.  The assumptions about your background that I've made are given with each description below.</p>      <p>I'd like to thank Fred J., Mike K. and David A. for all the typos that they've found and sent my way!  I've tried to proof read these pages and catch as many typos as I could, however it just isn't possible to catch all of them when you are also the person who wrote the material.  Fred, Mike and David have caught quite a few typos that I'd missed and been nice enough to send them my way.  Thanks again Fred, Mike and David!</p>      <p>If you are one of my current students and are here looking for homework assignments I've got a set of links that will get you to the right pages listed <a href="mystudents.aspx">here</a>.</p>    <p>At present I've gotten the notes/tutorials for my Algebra (Math 1314), Calculus I (Math 2413), Calculus II (Math 2414), Calculus III (Math 2415)<!--, Linear Algebra (Math 2318)--> and Differential Equations (Math 3301) class online.  I've also got a couple of Review/Extras available as well.  Among the reviews/extras that I've got are an Algebra/Trig review for my Calculus Students, a Complex Number primer, a set of Common Math Errors, and some tips on How to Study Math.</p>     <p>I've made most of the pages on this site available for download as well.  These downloadable versions are in pdf format.  Each subject on this site is available as a complete download and in the case of very large documents I've also split them up into smaller portions that mostly correspond to each of the individual topics.  Near the top of each page you will see one or two download buttons depending on whether the subject is available as only as a complete document or is also available in pieces.  You can see a complete listing of all the available downloads by selecting the <strong>Downloads</strong> option in the menu.</p>     </div>  </div></td>    <td width="15">&nbsp;</td>    <td width="200" valign="top">     <div align="center">     <g:plusone size="medium"></g:plusone>  <!-- Place this render call where appropriate --> <script type="text/javascript">     (function () {         var po = document.createElement('script'); po.type = 'text/javascript'; po.async = true;         po.src = 'https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js';         var s = document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0]; s.parentNode.insertBefore(po, s);     })(); </script></div>     <div class="News_Main">    <div class="News_Head">News</div>   <div class="News_Items">       <span class="BreadCrumb">9/7/2011 3:34:13 PM</span><br />    <span class="News_Headline">New Server</span> <br />    So, I finally managed to get the site to a new server.

It it still geared mostly     towards Calculus students with occasional comments on how a topic    will be used in a Calculus class. However, anyone needing a review of some    of the basic algebra, trig, exponential functions and logarithms should find    the information of use.      <p>Not all the topics covered in an Algebra or Trig class are covered in this  review. I've mostly covered topics that are of particular importance to students  in a Calculus class. I have included a couple of topics that are not that important  to a Calculus class, but students do seem to have trouble with on occasion.  As time permits I will be adding more sections as well.</p>    <p>The review is in the form of a problem set with the first solution containing detailed information on how to work that type of problem.  Later solutions are usually not as detailed, but may contain more/new information as required.</p>  <hr width="35%" color="#000000" size="1"><br />  <a href="/Extras/ComplexPrimer/ComplexNumbers.aspx">Complex Number Primer</a> - This is a brief introduction to some of the basic ideas involved with Complex Numbers.  The topics covered are a brief review of arithmetic with complex numbers, the complex conjugate, modulus, polar and exponential form and computing powers and roots of complex numbers.      <p>Note that this primer does assume that you've at least seen some complex numbers prior to reading.  The purpose of this document is go a little beyond what most people see when the first are introduced to complex numbers in say a College Algebra class.  Also, this document is in no way intended to be a complete picture of complex numbers nor do I cover all the concepts involved (that's a whole class in and of itself).</p>  <hr width="35%" color="#000000" size="1"><br />  <a href="/Extras/CommonErrors/CommonMathErrors.aspx">Common Math Errors</a> - As with the Algebra/Trig review this    was originally written for my Calculus I class. However, only one of the five    sections that I've given here directly addresses the topic of Calculus. The    other four sections are more general errors or cover Algebra and Trig errors.    There are a couple of calculus examples in the first four sections, but in    all of these cases I've also tried to provide non Calculus examples as well.    <p>This portion of the site should be of interest to anyone looking for common  math errors.
