The statement &quot;she killed me first&quot; was written on the bedroom wall, and &quot;bad news&quot; was written on the window blinds, investigators said in the document.</p><p>The images circulated online &quot;matched the deceased female, trauma we observed and the residence interior,&quot; the affidavit said. After the first photos were posted, the person claiming to be the killer replied to commenters who doubted the story: &quot;Check the news for Port Orchard, Washington, in a few hours. Her son will be home from school soon. He'll find her, then call the cops. I just wanted to share the pics before they find me.&quot;</p><p>Investigators said Coplin's body was found by her teenage son, who called his father to the scene about 2:50 p.m. Tuesday. His father called 911, they said.</p><p>Coplin's 2001 Ford Focus was missing, as were its keys, investigators said. So were Kalac's clothes and personal electronics, including his laptop and cellphone.</p><p>Investigators said they were able to trace Kalac's cellphone. About 6:20 a.m. Tuesday, he sent a two texts to a friend. According to the affidavit, the first read, &quot;S--- is all f----d now. You'll see me in the news.&quot; The second read, &quot;There will be no more me. ever, You'll read about it. That's all.&quot;</p><blockquote><p>&quot;I don't want to think I was sitting here and was my TV up too loud and why didn't I hear her?&quot;</p></blockquote><p>About 19 hours later, at 1:15 a.m. Wednesday, Coplin's car was spotted in Portland, police said. Portland police said a driver believed to be Kalac was pulled over during a traffic stop and then suddenly roared off in the 2001 Focus. They pursued him across a bridge and down a major road before calling off the chase when the driver began swerving into oncoming traffic, Portland police said.</p><p></p><div class="stack-inline-video">     <div class="stack-video-viewport">         <div class="stack-video-nojs-overlay">             <img src="/img/VideoPlayerNoJS.png" alt="This Video Player Requires JavaScript.
